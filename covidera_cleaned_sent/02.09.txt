i think we should focus on the fact that the music industry continues to thrive while producers and songwriters get less and less royalties due to streaming. I feel as songwriters that should be our concern. Not if someone decides to put their loop on splice & a next man uses it.
placements fall apart because a collaborator wanted a four figure advance from an artist with no label and like a 500 person following, But I believed in them and the record. In sessions it‚Äôs great for starting ideas when you‚Äôre not talented musically (like Me).
I don‚Äôt get the splice slander. First of all, if a producer chooses to put their shit on splice then that‚Äôs their grind. Cool. Secondly splice is great for finding drums / percs / weird stuff. It‚Äôs also great for when you‚Äôre producing for indie artists with no budget. I‚Äôve had...

The day Seungkwan became mentally exhausted because of the members. @pledis_17 #BOOtifulSeungkwan 
So much pressure for everyone to be this perfect role model all the time. We are HUMANS. We make mistakes. Just not everyone does it with cameras/tabloids waiting to write about it and magnify the issue. The fear of judgement 24/7. Self doubt. Criticism. Insecurities. Paranoia.
I wonder how many geniuses gave up on their passion cuz no one recognized how amazing they were & that makes me sad
I'm learning about the art of story and inherently character arcs. When a character has a pos. or neg. arc they change and grow as a person. When they have a flat arc the world changes they don't. Folks who play victim and want the world to change don't develop character.
