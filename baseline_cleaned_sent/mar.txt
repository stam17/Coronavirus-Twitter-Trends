This is important, because J uses the fiction of the detransitioning child to promote the idea that transness is the product of an offbeat theory of gender projected onto kids, rather than  experience of people from remarkably diverse backgrounds. But it’s perfectly real.

Anyone agnostic on trans civil rights could do worse than read through the essay and try to figure out what kind of life will be left for us, once all these “problems” have been solved. And perhaps also how exhausting it is to feel embattled in so many parts of our lives.

For example, not all trans women are rapists, Joyce graciously allows, but, because some are, all trans women should be kept out of women’s prisons and shelters. Should the same logic keep trans women off lesbian dating apps, or would that require a separate theory?
One of the best things a player could do this off season is skip all the bad habits of lazy pickup & play 1on1 “King of the Hill.” Get your teammates together & go at each other 1on1. You’ll get more reps on offense/defense & improve much faster, learn what actually works for 
Goddesses Uncaged? I'm here for it.
Obviously, I’m not rebutting these ideas here, just trying to give some sense of her essay’s scope. It’s a v. broad range of objections to trans rights that Joyce raises, and it’s not obvious that any solution, other than the eradication of trans people, would solve all of them.
