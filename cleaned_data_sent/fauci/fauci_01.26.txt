"It depends on the coronavirus, but neither SARS or MERS have been able to sustain human-to-human transmission the way influenza viruses can, Fauci says. That’s because the viruses haven’t fully adapted to infect humans, “and maybe they never will,” he says."
“What we haven ‘t seen outside of China is sustained person-to-person transmissibility. If that happens, then the implications for that are serious about having a global outbreak that could be serious in multiple countries,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci about the #coronavirus 
NIH'S FAUCI SAYS WE DON'T KNOW ACCURACY OF CORONAVIRUS SCREENING TEST... that's reassuring sleep on that one

“The thing we’re concerned about is the transmission from person-to-person,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on what’s most concerning him on the coronavirus. 
Coronavirus question to Dr Anthony Fauci who’s key to leading US response: What’s keeping you up at night? “Now we see...that you can actually have transmission from one to another...that’s called sustained transmission. When that happens the situation  more serious”
“The thing that would be of concern and that we're watching very carefully is what you call sustained transmission, from one person to another to another to another,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci 
it is possible it could turn into a global pandemic...that's why we are preparing for the worst" but a reminder: we have more deaths from the flu, from influenza, and we can't forget that. Dr. Anthony Fauci to @WmBrangham @NewsHour
on the spreading #coronavirus Dr. Anthony Fauci tells @WmBrangham "the thing that we are watching very carefully, is what we call sustained transmission, from one person, to another, to another" what is starting to happen in countries outside of China 1/3
The definitive opinion on this novel coronavirus by Dr Fauci. In brief 1. The measures taken by China are unprecedented and may work. 2. The current mortality rate of 2-3% will go down due to asymptomatic infected. 3. This is a nasty virus.  …
This from the loudest, most objectively ignorant voice on the planet regarding the W Africa Ebola outbreak, squealing, for example, about shutting down flights from the region when essentially there were none. Good Tony Fauci’s in the room. Hope the Great White Dope Klan listens.  …

At an @HHSGov press conference @NIAIDNews Director Anthony Fauci points out that even if asymptomatic transmission of nCoV does occur, the history of respiratory viruses tells us that it will not be a driver of the epidemic.
“There is no proven therapy for #coronavirus infection,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci says. “That is why it is so important that we get isolates of the virus, which we will soon have”

Fauci said that CDC disease detectives would need to see precisely how Chinese health authorities gathered their data. “...we have not seen the precise minute, granular data and how they collected it...We need to get to the real bottom line...and see if it’s valid.”
“The implications for this are so important that in my mind it’s absolutely critical that we ourselves see the data, because what goes on over there has implications for what happens here,” said A. Fauci, director National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases at the NIH

“If you’re afraid to fail, then you’re probably going to fail.” -Kobe Bryant
Fauci, Osterholm, and Scnaffner all are correct: Transparency and independent vetting of data are essential, significant transmission by asymptomatic persons is unlikely, and significant tramsmission by asymptomatic persons would require urgent revision of US policies.
Fauci: "we have not been invited" "it's absolutely critical that we ourselves see the data, because what goes on over there has implications for what happens here"
Partnering with @HHSgov & @CDCgov, #NIH is working quickly to respond to the outbreak of Wuhan coronavirus. @NIAIDnews Dr. Anthony Fauci says we will build on previous CoVs research to develop a vaccine ready for early human testing in  months   …
Maybe this is quibbling but transmission by an atypical, asymptomatic pt is still asymptomatic transmission. I believe Dr Anthony Fauci said a couple of days ago that shedding was possible 1-2 days prior to symptoms. Sometimes prudence takes priority over facts acquired too late.
But there’s one problem: China first has to invite the CDC. “Up to now, to my knowledge, we have not been invited,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health. #coronarvirus
