Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases weighs in on the conditions aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and what it could possibly reveal about the coronavirus  
Dr. Fauci said yesterday that the coronavirus is ‘on the verge’ of  a global pandemic, ‘unless containment is more successful than it is right now.’
The head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, China, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, died of the virus today, officials said. We're watching Dr. Anthony Fauci, an expert on infectious diseases, speak at a Council on Foreign Relations forum.  …
This is actually too slow - “Sanofi expects to have a vaccine candidate prototype to test in vitro within six months and could be ready to test the vaccine in people within a year or 18 months.” (Fauci previously said vaccine possibly ready in 1 year)  …
Dr. Fauci of @NIAIDNews is predicting coronavirus is on the verge of  a global pandemic. China must drastically increase transparency  clean on what it knew and when. Beijing is hindering a full global response.
2) Dr. Fauci on #COVID19 vaccine: “That 1-year timeline would be the world's record of ever getting a vaccine out. You can't do any better than that. If you go any faster, you'll be cutting dangerous corners.” ==> very true. You can’t rush Phase 1, Phase 2, then mass production.
Dr Fauci a brilliant and experienced medical scientist. Have admired him for years. His purpose by this statement is to continue to accelerate a serious global response to Coronavirus.  …
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that more than 40 Americans aboard the quarantined cruise liner in Japan tested positive for the coronavirus  
Is this as silly as it sounds? "Almost 300 people aboard the Diamond Princess tested positive. Fauci told CBS about 40 Americans are infected. Those showing symptoms won't be allowed on the plane. “If people...start to develop symptoms, they’ll be segregated within the plane.”

At least 44 of the ~400 Americans on #DiamondPrincess cruise ship have now tested positive for #COVID19. Of the 1,219 passengers who’ve been tested thus far, a whopping ~30% had #coronavirus. NIH’s Dr. Tony Fauci called the ship a “hot spot.”  …
#Coronavirus may be "at the brink" of a global pandemic- Anthony Fauci, Dir, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. WHAT’s NEW: Fresh cases in Japan, S Korea, Iran, Canada, Lebanon. Signs of a more sustained spread, spread of infection without showing of symptoms 
Fauci was very confident tonight on @CNBC interview with @megtirrell if cases evaded travel controls and were spreading, we’d have detected the spread in our epi surveillance. They must be relying on flu network, claims data, hospital reporting, and other public health feeds.
CDC hasn’t been able to get accurate tests to public health labs  manufacturers aren’t yet authorized by FDA. So CDC and 3 state labs (CA, NE, IL) are only ones available. Fauci was very confident on @CNBC if there was U.S. spread, epi surveillance would detect it.

Dr. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease on #Coronavirus "We are approaching [pandemic]. I think if we continue to have transmission in various parts of the world that it could turn into the classic definition of pandemic." 
It’s too early to determine whether the #COVID19 outbreak is slowing, @NIH immunologist Anthony Fauci says. New data from Chinese officials show fewer new cases & deaths. “I think we need a few more days to determine if that’s real or variability."  …
