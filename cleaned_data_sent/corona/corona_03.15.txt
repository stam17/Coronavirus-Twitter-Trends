Corona can simultaneously be both a major public health emergency and also not a life annihilating event. Carelessness of spring breakers and boomers unwilling to accept changes to normalcy leads to more danger and greater urgency for more severe restriction. Accept the situation
Corona has proved that everything around us is so temporary. Things our lives revolved around like work, gym, malls, movies, society have all gone for a toss as we are learning to live without them. It has taught us that in the end, it's our own home & family that keep us safe.

(3/4) Confinement -> Corona curbed but not eliminated ->Poverty -> lack of confidence of people and necessity to go out -> Surge of Corona -> Confinement 5- As a result, either we give ourselves the means of a total confinement (politically, economically and socially),
(1/4) I am not an expert, but below are some concerns with the strategy on #Corona despite all the efforts made in Lebanon: 1- confinement has been reinforced but is still not total 2- any confinement needs to be  by economic incentives and social protection

After @N12News Netanyahu appeared on @newsisrael13. All the channels run him live, every evening. There is no more need for LikudTV now that the enemies of the state broadcast him for free. Corona may be killing thousands, but it has given new life to Israel's PM. 
If Corona hit us like it has hit Italy, our death rate would probably be 2k per day...first of all, all govt hospitals are already full with patients......we have less than 100 ICU beds in this country most of which most of us can not afford...

There's now over 300 000 cases of Corona virus worldwide.
Anyone with serious symptoms should call the Sindh helpline for Corona on 021-99203443. They will send a team to check the suspected case. If qualified for the test, they will conduct the test at home and restrict the patient to home till the test results. This is what I know!
So @xainth kindly mocked up the slogan I suggested for the U.K. response to the corona emergency. Please copy/save/retweet widely if you think it helpful: 
Medical error alone kills approximately 30k to 35k people a MONTH every month. Not a damn thing is done about it. If corona is not killing more than 10 times that amount, AT A MINIMUM, then how in the world can any of this lockdown & financial destruction be justified??

If you don't think this media coverage of Corona isn't about the President, @abcnews just broken away after the president left the press conference. Never mind what FEMA, the VP or anyone else had to say.
Even if you don‚Äôt like Sheikh Gumi, find time and watch/listen to this. Corona Virus  ‚Ä¶ MBBS and PhD Usool al-Fiqh.
Very irresponsible to tweet a post showing physical contact at a time while the Government is working hard spreading awareness about corona. Besides... What if Nawaz Sharif has Corona. Now he's given it to Shahbaz Sharif and he's bringing it home to Pakistan. Smh.

We all have  up for this Corona Virus and put our all efforts regarding to any kind of facilities for poor people or white collars. You can join us with my team of @HamaraPaakistan and with @FeedthepoorsOfc to donate Rations for daily wages families. #UnitedWeStand
Bernie fucking Sanders has raised 2 fucking million dollars for Corona relief and does web town halls every other night and Biden has done NOTHING. You think Bernie  better than Joe? No. He is delegating and getting his staff to help. Like a fucking leader.

First time in SF since Corona hit. Mostly empty streets. Some wearing masks. Somehow, many have taken up jogging (or runners are the only ones going out). Parking available everywhere. Where'd the cars go? Feels like Christmas morning on a random Saturday.

Rather than sharing and giving audience to those trying to show #Corona as a political or religious conspiracy against a group or section of society simply better to report the accounts & lodge  with FIA. Don't present a few ignorants as popular representatives of ppl
When you have symptoms of corona and mom says "Haldi wala dudh pi" Scientists who are trying to create the vaccines : 
Can't stop thinking about the aftermath of all this. There's probably gonna be a corona-themed memorial day. The impact on mental health, on dating/relationships, the  baby boom, the economy, work from home culture, the way we value leisurely activities.
NDTV deduces that Corona is safer than flu. Corona as a killer is a Myth. Italy, Iran, Spain ,UK, China, US & Europe wont agree with this silly channel & who ever runs it. Corona is a bloody Biological weapon. NDTV needs to learn more about such weapons and their objectives.
When this corona finally leaves we are all having a old Nollywood theme party:

This corona virus quarantine will teach y'all to stop dating these "where you taking me to eat" females & start looking for "dinner be ready by 7 babe". You out here in quarantine with a woman who can't cook, you gonna eat beauty???

@narendramodi Sir, We Punekars are ready for #JantaCurfew, which means "Care for you" and following all your instructions  isolating ourselves for the day. We together will win fight against Corona by saving saving our people and our India. 
PM Modi led indian Govt takes strict measures to curb corona virus pandemic Indian govt shuts domestic and local trains and public stores to curb public movements
I might be wrong due to limited knowledge about medical science and Corona virus but I feel that a country like India has a lot of potential for the spread of the virus because too many people are too densely packed & they don‚Äôt care too much. A 14 days curfew may be a good idea.

Doctor Usama (Shaheed)...A hero who lost his life treating Corona patients.. #lockdownpakistan

It would be naive, to believe that Corona Virus is not a Biological weapon. China may have slipped for some time-but has managed to achieve its strategic objectives of damaging world economy & being the sole player. If India beats corona & it would have beaten China too.
Can't Wait For The Day To Hear "Corona Virus Is Finally Gone"
There's a lesson learned for the Post Corona Wrestling Era: (I don't curse often so allow me.) Chill with the petty shit. All that hating and aggression and jealousy matters for WHAT right now? They took it away from ALL OF US. We need togetherness as workers more than ever.
My fiance works at a Corona crisis center. It‚Äôs long hours, stressful, dangerous. When  home: - House is clean - Dinner is ready - Laundry is done All I want her to do is focus on saving lives. Take care of the health care professionals around you. We need them.

To enable government to deal with the challenge of Corona imposition of CORONA TAX on rich individuals needs to be given consideration.
Stop living in your la la land&face hard facts--fact is,India is leading,war against #Corona. Airlifting 1444 people from China,Iran,Japan& Italy,setting up $10mn SAARC fund,sending aid to Maldives&Israel&taking lead in bringing G20 together--we are doing what needs to be done!  ‚Ä¶
With 793 deaths, this was the deadliest day for Italy. This should tell us Kashmiris that when this Corona thing goes out of control how much dangerous it can be. If, with world class health infrastructure and facilities, Italy couldn't do much about it, what can we do? 1/2
One in 28 individual tested today has resulted in +ve case for #Corona virus. Yesterday one in 34 individual tested had resulted in +ve case. What‚Äôs more worrying is the testing rate... yesterday 1028 individuals tested while today 1210 individuals. 79 new +ve cases in 24 hrs.  ‚Ä¶
Now that the WHO has declared Europe the new epicenter of the virus, I think it's only fair that this so-called menace "Corona-chan" gets a proper redesign. 
When the Corona Virus finally exhausts itself and the danger is over, let's do something good for our country and spend our holidays in England, eat in local restaurants, buy British products, buy local meats and veggies and support local businesses. Retweet if you agree.
