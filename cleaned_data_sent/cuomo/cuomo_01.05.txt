I’m frustrated to hear @NYGovCuomo get it so wrong on education funding. His smoke & mirrors game to micromanage existing funding misses the point: the biggest injustice is that the system is not fully funded per the law. Follow the Foundation Aid formula. (1/2)

It's inexcusable that @NYGovCuomo made no mention of the education crisis in Rochester. In a district serving largely Black and Brown students, 200 teachers and staff members were laid off mid-year. There's a civil rights crisis happening right in front of your eyes.
Here’s the key question for @NYGovCuomo at his #SOTS2020: You project a $6B deficit in 2020. Will you finally lean in to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy and #MakeBillionairesPay, or will you continue to try to fix your budget with austerity economics?
Its shameful that @NYGovCuomo hasn't funded our schools in all his years in office. Now he's using @AQE_NY talking points. Were tired of rhetoric. Fund the damn schools. #FundNYSchools #SOTS2020
His set up to the education section was so misleading. Yes- NY ranks 49th in the nation when  to equity. The state should close this gap- but @NYGovCuomo is the biggest obstacle to doing so because he refuses to fund the state's own Foundation Aid formula. #SOTS2020
