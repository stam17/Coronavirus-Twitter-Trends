All over the country elected officials are scrambling to get people out of jail & prison. But here in NY, @NYGovCuomo & @NYSenDems are actively working to put MORE people in jail. It’s hypocritical, illogical, and flies in the face of public health and safety. Why ever? Why now?
My SO, an MD at Harlem Hospital, got a broken  to work (110th St. Station burned out, FYI). Went to Larry's bike shop on 110th to sort it out. Huge line but she was ushered to the front with her H+H ID. Dear @NYCMayor, @NYGovCuomo: #BikesAreEssential!
Cuomo running NY State just like he ran HUD. A criminal enterprise stealing billions for himself and friends.
You corrupt disgusting piece of garbage @NYGovCuomo we all know damn well you sat on those available ventilators to cause damage to @realDonaldTrump 
Applying supply and demand to something nessecary during a pandemic that has been proven to be price gouged is an infant move
The humanity and leadership from @NYGovCuomo is so reassuring & heartwarming 
PLEASE HELP: Right now. *Literally right now* on same night these horrifying numbers came out, NY Democrats are meeting behind closed doors. To discuss repealing bail reform that’s already saved thousands from Rikers. @NYSenDems & @NYGovCuomo right now want to jail more. Outrage! 
Copy of @NYGovCuomo’s executive order allowing partners into hospital delivery rooms for births, moving the presidential primaries & special elections, & tax day is below. 
New York is nearing peak, rate of hospitalization per Cuomo is slowing. A New York, Conn. NJ federally enforced quarantine would be ruinous and instill mass panic.

Takeover...NY State...uh....did you hear anything Cuomo said about the need for ventilators via federal action? He's right. Trump has failed, and continues to fail. Dont just need  making v'lators.

California Department of Corrections has tested only 197 inmates. Guess it's no surprise only 1 positive test.

There is nothing to consider, @NYGovCuomo. This needs to happen right now.  …
release them where? back out to homes and families quarantined? sux but at this point there’s nothing that can be done but move em to a hospital setting or mobilize a triage outside of the prison to isolate those infected with those not yet infected
.....like @NYGovCuomo I do my accounting while listening to his dulcet tones during his daily update presser. Calming. reassuring. No worries; Cuomo has thought of it first and already attending to it. Peeeeeeeace.

Sorry, but Trump has NOT "done a wonderful job with this virus." In fact, it is probably the worst presidential response to a national security concern in the history of our once great nation.

I and others sent out 
"We're so appreciative of your help and that of so many others who have stepped up." Gov. Cuomo wrote on social media. 
Thanks for your kind words. Appreciate them at this time
I love how much people hate NY but not our money. I think everyone who doesn't like our state should return the NY portion of fed money they take and let us have it back
Be responsible and keep your NY cooties in NY, @NYGovCuomo. That’s what a LEADER would do. But, you lot  if he does nothing  if he does something.

Trump is just trying to drove the news cycle narrative with a shiny object.
Me too, John. The infected NY traveler was intercepted at the airport I always fly from. FL already has enough issues, and I feel it's irresponsible of @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor not to have locked down those hotspots. Instead, NYers are dispersing throughout the country.
Governor Andrew Cuomo is doing a phenomenal job and Americans in every corner of the country owe him a debt of gratitude. He is getting us through this. Thank you, @NYGovCuomo.
We're ALREADY 'Shelter in place.' Like @NYGovCuomo said, "What (TF-I'll insert that there for him, cuz I KNOW he was thinking it)...does trump even mean by, 'quarantine' !?"
45 goal is to make it appear NYS is a police state. His re-elect will use photos and videos of the lockdown when the death rate hits the apex and he faces blame for the lack of early enough action on tests, PPE and ventilators. He is setting up Cuomo and Dems to blame.
NYC it turns out, was sitting on thousands of ventilators, yet POTUS got them more after  Now they have a surplus & not distributing(hoarding) them. That is the issue. U r right, but Dem's will tell u differently.
Gov Cuomo's late great dad, Mario, famously said "you campaign in poetry and govern in prose." It is time for us to focus on the skills needed to govern - like @NYGovCuomo is doing now - and less on the political flare. Our future depends on the leaders we elect.
Americans think they are inmortal, they pay attention to global situation. They live in their own bubble.

I do think someone who sees that headline and doesn't read the story could think the RI order is much more aggressive than it is. (Even though it is incredibly unusual.) Cuomo himself seems to think RI is refusing to let people in with NY plates, which is not the case.
You're right @NYGovCuomo we must 1) Plan Forward 2) Be Proactive-Not Reactive 3) Get Ahead. It starts w/ shutting down NY's live (wet) markets - the cause of #Covid_19 & all pandemics. In #NYC there are 85 wet markets; are we the next Wuhan? @HealthNYGov @NYCHealthCommr 
Cuomo's right to to be concerned. Trump's just seeking to hurt NY while DeSantis hasn't prepared at all for the onslaught from open beaches.

I just gave my legal views on air with @AnaCabrera re: Trump’s vaguely threatening noises about federal control of states and borders (in sum: agree with @NYGovCuomo, it’s legally dubious). And, non-legally, just as a regular Jersey guy: step back.
Cuomo got exposed by @POTUS and is quite puffed up about it! @NYGovCuomo is either   as Democrat governors are, and was unaware of his own stockpile 2) was hiding the stockpile of ventilators He should talk less now and get busy with charity!

Cuomo can't have it both ways. If it's okay for New Yorkers to travel to Florida, it should be okay for New Yorkers to travel around their neighborhoods. Which is it, Governor?

Oh, @NYGovCuomo, how you lie! Stockpile is storage! Keep the coverup going. If you have any of these ventilators left over, you might donate them to another state in need. Don’t HOARD the needed goods!
 agree. Masks for everyone and set up quarantine centers for positive pts with mild symptoms. There are a lot of tragic stories in Wuhan: one got infected, then other family members fell ill one by one, sometimes only the young kid was left in the whole family.
I agree. It’s a bandaid but it buys him the time he needs to pivot away from the fact the city’s issues are his fault for socializing the health care system. It will distract people from the truth.

Gov. Cuomo is asked about Pres. Trump’s claim that New York has ventilators in storage: "That is incorrect and grossly uninformed." He then says: “We have ventilators in a stockpile, and we didn’t send them to the hospitals yet.” 
As President Trump weighs a possible quarantine for the New York area, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says "I don't think it's legal": "I don't believe that any federal administration could be serious about a physical lockdown ... I don't think the American people would stand for it"

“It’s preposterous,” said Cuomo. Sounds like New York would go to federal court to oppose a federally enforced lockdown. This one could be fast tracked to SCOTUS.
Dear American neighbours. I really hope you deal with your ‘president’ Seriously, how long do you think you have before he starts sending COVID19 patients into concentration camps? #COVID19 @NYGovCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime
. @NYGovCuomo on @CNN says NY is already in a quarantine and what President Trump is talking about sounds like a lockdown. Cuomo says of a possible lockdown: I don’t think this is plausible. I don’t think it’s legal. You have states rights. It would be total chaos.
New: Gov. Cuomo on CNN says he spoke to the president *before* the NY/NJ/CT remarks and Trump "never mentioned anything about a quarantine" but the two men haven't spoken since. Cuomo added the possible quarantine idea would be "wholly counterproductive" and "total mayhem."
"In no hospital in New York will a woman be forced to be alone when she gives birth. Not now, not ever," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo shared. 
We don’t care about delegate math. Delegate math won’t get us healthcare, make prescription drugs affordable, save our planet, end the wars, or root out corruption. Biden is unacceptable, just like Trump is unacceptable. There are other options if that’s the best they can offer.
This idea of a CT NY NJ federal quarantine is absurd! Cuomo is right — would paralyze the economy. Massive damage.
Responding to  from earlier today that New York State May undergo “mandatory quarantine” @NYGovCuomo tells @cnn “geographically restricting a state will paralyze the financial sector. I don’t even think that’s legal.”
On CNN, @NYGovCuomo says he thinks it would be illegal to confine New York residents to their state. “That would be a lockdown,” Cuomo said. “Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that doesn’t make any sense.”
Listen to this gavone. THE FACT IS THEY EXIST, @NYGovCuomo, the ventilators exist. When he’s done in New York he should consider a run for mayor in Puerto Rico  …
Here's my theory. Trump knows he effed up this response big time. He has lied about the severity, denied the science and fought with @NYGovCuomo who is doing a great job with this. 1/15  …
Thank you! Next up #nomedicaidecuts #RENTRELIEF
Thanks for suggesting pharmacies can help @NYGovCuomo. Don’t forget the thousands of independent pharmacies across the state that have been providing doorstep delivery (and enhanced pharmacy services) for years! @NY_Pharmacists @pssny #cpesn @Commpharmacy
@NYGovCuomo refused 2 buy ventilators for NY in 2015 & asked 2 draft plan 2 ration care via death panel scenario, then wasted taxpayers $$on #BuffaloBoondoggle. In 2019 he celebrated legalizing 9 mo abortions. So, no you can’t assume others think this  …
NYC needs to freeze rent. It’s the only way small business will survive. @NYGovCuomo
@NYGovCuomo was on today. We are up to date without the lies and anger!
Cuomo isn’t Mariano Rivera & there is no need to shit on Democracy & go to a closer, when we have had a starting pitcher all along throwing straight heat, Bernie!
Agree. I like the @ScottAdamsSays saying: Judge the speed of the corrections, not the mistakes. Cuomo and Trump are both doing a good job. I don't care what NY did 2 years ago or what Trump said 2 months ago. They've both upped their game to met the occasion.
Updated FT curve: not good news- as US tops 120k cases, still not any sign of our curve flattening - we are still steepest in world. Only mild cause for optimism is NY showing slight flattening today, but Cuomo unsure if it will stick. We need a national lockdown folks and NOW! 
You are an amazing woman. If I didn’t have @NYGovCuomo I would pick you.
Thank you to my state senator @RJackson_NYC for standing up for #BudgetJustice! We don't have a revenue problem; we have a longstanding fairness problem, and we need to start fixing it NOW. @NYGovCuomo 
250,000 protective face masks to medical professionals in NYC on your way @NYGovCuomo. WE ARE WAVES FROM THE SAME SEA 
Check this out @realDonaldTrump, @NYGovCuomo , and @NYCMayor. And you wonder why NYC has the most cases of Covid-19. Way to keep people apart...smh
We need @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @BronxDAClark @CyVance @MelindaKatz @BrooklynDA @StatenIslandDA & @NYPDShea to do their part to flatten the absolutely horrifying Rikers curve. They must stop sending people to Rikers immediately and #FreeThemAll now. No more excuses. We need 
Yesterday, @NYGovCuomo released 1,100 people from NY jails being held for alleged technical violations of parole, like missing a meeting. There are 4,500 people in NY prisons already sentenced for technical parole violations. They need to be released too.  …
“When a state is bankrupt either I have to raise taxes or slash education funding. And you’re going to see education cut all across this state.”  … #Millennials #UniteBlue Just maybe, @NYGovCuomo, if you quit wasting $$on illegals & other PC ...
The issue isn’t that Mayor and First Lady took a walk. It’s that they travelled all the way to Brooklyn from the Upper East Side to do it, in open defiance of rules he has himself endorsed. Also, Gov. Cuomo has asked people to stay out of parks. This is confusing & dangerous.  …
Why not Freez it just like as New York? How grace period is going to help if you don't have any  Does any of You thought of this or just did it becuse You had to do something? Freeze the Mortgages as New York Did it. @NYGovCuomo can you Please help him understand!!!
Rent is due in 4 days!! @NYGovCuomo must cancel rents+provide rental assistance ASAP. Check out these campaigns: @housing4allNY #CancelRent @RentJustice #RentFreeze @RTCNYC #EvictionMoratorium @NYHomeless #YesToHSS My op-ed on the housing crisis here:  
So @cnnbrk reports hospitals low on ventilators, having to dbl up. @POTUS reports his knowledge @NYGovCuomo has 4000 that WH sent. Gov Cuomo says @POTUS is grossly uninformed.........but goes to say they DO have stockpile. @CNN reports as if @POTUS is wrong....BUT HE's RIGHT
Like Governor Murphy who hides illegal aliens in churches to prevent ICE from getting to them? Or Cuomo who supports no cash bail and lets violent criminals right back on the street after they are arrested? If  to you, no wonder you think Trump’s   …
This morning Cuomo said he had never heard of a ventilator until the Coronavirus. That may be why he refused to restock the 15,000 necessary to replenish NY's emergency supply after the H1N1 epidemic. Ironic that the state with free healthcare for all lacks medical supplies.  …
THANK YOU @NYGovCuomo FOR MANDATING BIRTH SUPPORT!! MOUNT SINAI HAS REVERSED IT'S VISITATION BAN Please spread the word in your networks
This is why I can’t figure out why @GovRonDeSantis is saying “New Yorkers  here”. No worry! State is run like a cesspool. Better idea for @NYGovCuomo to tell #Florida to stay out of #NY #coronavirus
Sure let’s nominate a guy who didn’t run... why do we even bother with primaries?
Gov Cuomo of NY thinks this is a bad idea or so he says. Yet aren’t the police already at NY’s borders? Seems a wise decision to me to contain the virus where it is rather than let the citizens carry it into other states. Cuomo’s got to go! IFBMKP  …
I predicted this over a week ago. The DNC will do anything to not have Bernie as the nomination. Just wait til Cuomo’s VP is Hilary, picked behind closed doors due to Dem Convention being shut down from COVID. Rigging another primary.  …
It’s everywhere dickwad!
Who's got that video of the reporter asking Cuomo about the warehouses full of respirators not being used or moved?
. @NYGovCuomo is trying to cut Medicaid during the budget negotiations in Albany. Cuts to Medicaid in the middle of a pandemic are UNACCEPTABLE! #NoMedicaidCuts / “Andrew Cuomo: The surprising rise of the New York governor” - CNNPolitics  …
. @JuliaCarmel__ ? You seem like a helpful person on this kinda thing. We’re NY! @NYGovCuomo
If you're having a bad day just remember that @ericswalwell blew his ass out on national television, Biden thinks there's a Luhan Virus, Cuomo got caught stockpiling ventilators, and Hillary is getting ratioed like a MOFO! #Trump2020
I just had an emergency c section @nyphospital and gave birth to my daughter alone. I then had to care for her in my room, alone after major surgery. I’m still in the hospital. When will the private hospitals like @nyphospital have  by this order?
So $10-$15 Billion? Is that the federal relief aid New York State needs in 2020? For our students in schools. For folks who need healthcare. Otherwise, massive cuts. If so, let us know how to help you. Thank you @NYGovCuomo @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @NitaLowey @BrianLehrer
REPORT: Gov. Andrew Cuomo ( @NYGovCuomo) Admits Stockpile of Thousands of Unused Ventilators. Governor Cuomo acknowledged Friday the state did have a stockpile of unused ventilators, despite  @realDonaldTrump was not sending  …
Cuomo looks awful here. Shame on him.  …
As a Floridian, I wish w/every fiber of my being that Gov. Cuomo ran Florida too. Unlike the clown who runs our state, Cuomo isn’t selling fantasies or scapegoating other states, he isn’t trying to manipulate the narrative or placing money over people’s lives. That’s sufficient.
It only took 3 weeks and hundreds of deaths for @NYGovCuomo to halt construction work. I continued to be impressed by this very bold, definitely-not-in-the-pocket-of-real-estate leadership!  …
If @realDonaldTrump has to quarantine New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, THANK YOUR GOVERNORS. Cuomo didn't even know that he had two warehouses of respirators. The feds had to tell him where to find them IN HIS OWN STATE.
I sometimes do things I wish I hadn't. Yesterday, I made a poorly timed remark about Gov. Cuomo's abortion record. He is fighting around the clock for other lives right now, which deserves appreciation/support, not a badly-timed "gotcha" remark. I regret this and apologize.
5/5 Enforcement of #COVID state #Quarantine not feasible, contrary to US values. @POTUS didn't consult. @NYGovCuomo would refuse to deploy state police to enforce & @POTUS couldn't order state enforcement Having armed US military patrolling massive border would provoke 
- thank you, @GavinNewsom and @NYGovCuomo 
If the pharmacists answer your call @NYGovCuomo (even though many independent pharmacies already offer free home delivery), will you then reconsider vetoing PBM legislation that helps to keep these same pharmacies from closing their door when they ask a favor from you again?
TY @NYGovCuomo for moving the presidential primary from April 28th to June 23rd. Now we need to change the absentee ballot law so all NYers can get an absentee ballot for the primary and general election.  …
It’s important to listen to the voices of the medical workers throughout our hospitals who are leading the fight against coronavirus. @CDCgov @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @POTUS - get them the supplies they need! All videos from today are here -  …
Yo, Kenyan governors and other politicians too, watch one @NYGovCuomo NY Governor’s press briefings. Good grasp of the topic (COVID19 Pandemic), honest and forthright. #Covid_19
Why would NY Governor Andrew Cuomo say he had no ventilators, when he had thousands of them hidden in storage?
100. One hundred incarcerated people, locked inside cages in an island fortress, left to sicken and suffer. How many others haven’t been reported? @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @ManhattanDA where is your humanity? You’re ignoring theirs.  …
Then as a medical provider, you will also agree 1) studies prove women fare better and recover better when they have a support person, 2) if a mother labors alone and has  she deserves to have someone there to advocate for her and to make medical decisions.
Trump's new campaign ad — entitled, of all things, "Hope" — casts his response to the pandemic in heroic terms, features video of @GavinNewsom and @NYGovCuomo praising him, and makes Dr. Fauci correcting him sound like praise too  
To deal with state budget shortfalls during the pandemic emergency, @NYGovCuomo should

Teen Vogue readers are probably more informed about Andrew Cuomo than CNN viewers. 
From NY,voted Obama/Biden then Trump. I’ll be voting Trump 2020. Btw, before this crisis no local hospitals were prepared for a catastrophe. The waiting room time before this Pandemic was ridiculous at any decent hospital with High marks. @NYGovCuomo spent money on solar instead.
so bc we live in new york state we’re not eligible for the $600 a week ??? can anyone explain to me why @NYGovCuomo thinks that now is the time to cut medicaid and hospital funding ?
Thank you Governor Cuomo!  …

Bernie needs to directly address this if he wants to be able to win the primary. His campaign needs to broadcast the many examples of Biden having cognitive issues and he needs to start talking about it. It's the only way to get enough media  …

Yes, it's ok, because by doing so, the lives of that persons family are saved, and potentially hundreds more. It's not to punish, but to protect.
So Gov. Cuomo says -contrary to Trump - that he’s never talked to Trump about a quarantine. Turns out Trump’s worried about infected people leaving NY, NJ, and CT and . . . traveling to Florida?
Lol he just cut Medicaid by $38 billion in the epicenter of the pandemic
Sources inside WH indicate they were  by surprise by how ill prepared NYC hospitals were. The task force was given false assurances by Cuomo on capabilities, modest at best, but in reality were in dire need of literally everything. Feds racing to take over. #NYC
This guy cut 20,000 hospital beds. Even now incarcerated people are starving themselves in his state. He is trying to rehab his image. We can not let him.
I'm incredibly isolated. I wait by my self to watch @NYGovCuomo every day to get my daily dose of humanity
Cuomo budget due April 1st had a shortage of 10 billion before the virus.
And this is why you don't make policy announcements on Twitter. *cough* @realDonaldTrump
The forced closing of @SBHBronx that would occur from MRT  is unacceptable & unfair to  its employees, and sets a bad precedent for all hospitals that serve poor &  @NYGovCuomo do NOT accept these cuts & help keep SBH open

I have been in  with @NYGovCuomo and @GovMurphy, and I look forward to speaking to the President directly about  and any further enforcement actions, because confusion leads to panic. (3/3)
I'm not a big fan of Cuomo.. like at all. And I don't think he deserves all of the praise everyone has been giving him. But he does prove why it's better to vote for a corporate Democrat over a Republican in the general. Like at least they aren't actively trying to kill us my god
Here’s @LesterHoltNBC who didn’t make a PEEP when NewYork leaders told their residents 2B out in HUGE groups when they KNEW the #coronavirus danger. They were too busy calling Trump a racist. This is WHY #NewYork was hit so hard. @NYGovCuomo, We should be suing YOU for this.  
I listen to @NYGovCuomo over trump every single day! 
@NYGovCuomo please put these folks & medical personnel up in the poshest hotel rooms NOW  …
Is Governor Cuomo the one hoarding all the toilet paper along with those thousands of ventilators he stockpiled?
1) That's news to @NYGovCuomo 2) Pretty sure it'll end up in court because it doesn't seem legal. 3) At this point I fully expect Trump to declare martial law, cancel elections and install himself as Caesar 
fun fact everyone.. family friend who sells Marry-K told us that Mary-K has been approached to supply the hand wipes.. By the way friends the majority of their manufacturer bases are in China ..
If you  and impressed by @NYGovCuomo leadership during this crisis, remember before being governor he was Secretary of HUD and Attorney General of NY State. Experience matters.

It was horrible to see mine go to the ER with COVID19 without me. I feel for these parents-to-be, but we are asking people to die alone now, and I wish the Governor had taken the safer path here.
My heart breaks for people who have had to put off IVF & other family building med tx during this crisis. So grateful to @NYGovCuomo, @bradhoylman, @AmyPaulin & other great leaders for fighting 4 #NYfamilies by including #CPSA in the budget. Hope my AM joins them @yuhline

One of the stories of 2019 was that folks didn’t reward executive experience anymore and were turning to senators. Can’t help but wonder what voter reaction would be to governors like @stevebullockmt and @NYGovCuomo and big city mayors like @ericgarcetti and @MitchLandrieu now
Cuomo is using this crisis to booster his political career and to divert Covid-19 monies to fill in the gaps that they have neglected for years.
Biden needs to drop out now. He’s simply not fit to run and Trump would walk all over him in the debates. #Bernie2020
Cuomo said in noon presser today he did not like the sound of curfews. Implied it was not legal. Cuomo doing an awesome job dealing with both pandemic and Trump lies and diversions!

Governors @NYGovCuomo @GovMurphy and @GovNedLamont had better quickly dissuade @realDonaldTrump of the notion that he has the authority to impose a curfew on states or you may as well let him call off the election.
NYC sounding more & more like Puerto Rico 's corrupt ones. Ventilators in a warehouse they didn't know about. Wanting the country to fix everything that was already crap long before the #pandemic hit.
This happened last night. This is serious folks. The @ECDOH and the @ECSONY1 closed down these 2 establishments were not following the executive order issued from @NYGovCuomo. #StayHomeSaveLives If you violate the law you will be

This is @GovAbbott He takes care of his people Be like Gov. Abbott @NYGovCuomo 
Both NY and CA have depended on the fed govt for decades to prop up their socialist policies. Always good to remind people that fed tax money is our money and the entire country shouldn't have to pay for them to squander their state budgets buying votes.
FOH with this race to the bottom lesser of two evil bull. We have a guy in the running whose entire platform would have prevented this entire crisis were it in place. We seriously should not be setting the bar for leadership at Trump and accepting anything marginally better.

As per @NYGovCuomo The New York Presidential Primary has been postponed until June 23rd. Pass it On. #NewYorkPrimary #Bernie2020
I don’t understand why my fellow nurses are begging for ventilators in New York just reported on the news when @NYGovCuomo said this morning they have thousands in stockpile. Get them the hell out of stockpile.
Not sure what: "- @NYGovCuomo on calls to raise taxes on wealthy to deal with #coronavirus outbreak" means. But that was not the question. The question was a general one on raising taxes in general. As such, Cuomo answered appropriately.
Q: "Is tax increase for businesses and wealthy individuals off the table?" @NYGovCuomo: "I don’t know how you raise taxes on people who are out of work and their business is closed because government needs more funding." Excuse me, Gov: $1M+ earners are not the ones out of jobs.
Ask yourself, why would Governor  he had no ventilators, when in FACT, he had thousands of them in storage?

NYC and the 5 Burroughs are the hot spots. Western NY is 400 miles, 7 hour drive from NYC. Cuomo should not be spreading The Corona Virus across NYS by transporting patients all the way here. He's putting additional lives at Risk. What happened to isolating the virus?
Voting is sooo overrated, or so the @DNC believes. They'd prefer to just pick the nominee rather than have all those pesky voters decide.
Liberals 1.5 months ago: even if Bernie has a plurality, it doesn't matter. We'll appoint Michelle O. Liberals 2 weeks ago: BERNIE NEEDS TO DROP OUT, WE ALREADY HAVE A NOMINEE!! AARGH!1 Liberals yesterday: Even if Biden is a rapist, he's our nominee. Liberals today: Wow, Cuomo!

Let @NYGovCuomo know that we demand rent relief / suspension And call you state representatives and say you support BILL 8125 from @SenGianaris  …
Totally possible -- but Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Denver in Feb and March? International travel to and from China effects every major city in the US. So why not a rampant outbreak in every major city at the same rate? Honest questions here.
Whether he drops out or not, he’s already lost. It’s mathematically impossible for him to win, so this is an exercise in futility and arroagance on his part. #ByeByeBernie
Adjusting the  tax brackets for earners over $5million is just one of many ways you do it. @NYGovCuomo's argument is bogus. But he knows that. It's up to @AndreaSCousins & @CarlHeastie to fight for what's right.  …

55% of our Country's CV19 cases are in New York City alone. 3 other Cities make up nearly the rest. All 4 are Sanctuary Cities.
Cuomo is a Neoliberal his panel  400m in Hospital cuts amidst the Coronavirus Pandemic as Brooklyn elects call it Cruel & inhumane, this mofo wants to cut Medicaid, he endorsed Biden months ago & is ready willing and able to cheat just like he fukd Brooklyn in 2k16
Glad to see my union join with 6 other unions calling on Cuomo to ask wealthy New Yorkers to pay their fair share of taxes instead of relying solely on cuts to education and healthcare resolve the state’s budget
9 out of 10 NYers, including 2.5 million union workers, know we have to tax the under-taxed wealthy to prevent brutal cuts. Listen up @NYGovCuomo @AndreaSCousins @CarlHeastie!! @strongforall @es_indivisible @ny_indivisible @nychange @SenatorBiaggi @RJackson_NYC  …

Everyone who said bringing up Biden’s cognitive decline  to Bernie is “ableism” will use the same cognitive decline as evidence for why we have *no choice* but to draft Cuomo.
In Opinion Maureen Dowd writes, “To the surprise of many who did not associate the name ‘Andrew Cuomo’ with the word ‘empathy,’ the governor has  a sort of national shrink, talking us through our fear, our loss and our growing stir-craziness.” 
DO NOT as I repeat DO NOT TRUST @NYGovCuomo Take it from me as a New Yorker. High Taxes, releasing criminals. PLUS Closing hospitals way back in 2015. Do your research, Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. DO NOT BE Fooled people.
It's also why he demanded more money for New York in the Covid funding bill. $3.8 billion for hospitals/expenses not enough? He's trying to get American taxpayers to pay off his unrelated debts.

Honestly, if something - God forbid - were to happen to Joe, I'd want the Democratic convention to draft Cuomo or some other big state governor. Bernie is a *sure loss*.  …
It's going to be hilarious how Joe underperforms Hillary!
“Governor Cuomo’s refusal to free incarcerated people is nothing short of a death sentence.” You should also tell @NYGovCuomo why we should #FreeThemAll4PublicHealth! Post a video tagging us and Governor Cuomo with why you support #FreeThemAll

Governor Cuomo, let's say you test positive for the virus. Would you refuse to take HydroxyChloraquine? Asking for a patient in NYC.
By extort the federal government you mean the citizens of other states
According to YouGov majority of Democrats want Bernie Sanders to stay in the race Dont let these neoliberal shills in  fool you
. @NYGovCuomo is winning praise for his coronavirus response, but ER nurse Sean Petty says Cuomo is probably the person most responsible for a shortage of hospital beds. "In New York state, we’ve gone from 73,000 beds to 53,000 beds" since 2000, he says.  
@BernieSanders IS the safe choice. By @rockyowens &

There's approximately 40,000 #COVID19 cases between NYC and NJ. Yet we're still running traines between the two. The virus stays on plastic and stainless steel the longest. Shut down the PATH trains. @GovMurphy @NYGovCuomo @CoryBooker
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that he spoke with President Trump on Saturday morning, but they did not discuss a quarantine for the state. "I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable," Cuomo said. 
And don't be swayed by Cuomo and  @realDonaldTrump. They're just politicking - trying to appear bipartisan for a later run at the presidency. It's all an act! #STOPVOTINGDEMOCRAT
"Now is not the time to be relying on the voluntarism of corporations" - @NYGovCuomo

There are over 2 dozen primaries left. Please educate
March 2, 2020 @NYGovCuomo and @NYCHealthCommr tell 8 million New Yorkers not to worry about the virus because IT COULD NOT BE SPREAD through casual contact. One of the most irresponsible statements since the start of 
NY sends $25 billion more to federal government than we get back. And, we cede powers such  factories to build ventilators. Thus, there is only so much @NYGovCuomo can do: we need the federal government in long-tail crisis like this.
And yet American popular discourse still uses liberal and left interchangeably
Thank you @NYGovCuomo for moving the #Primary election in NY to June 23rd. It's the safe/smart thing to do.

"I don't like to look at the data on any one night. We average three or four nights to get a more consistent track, but this is good news on a one-day number." Exactly what @NYGovCuomo said during his briefing -- using data, facts and science to drive decision-making.  …
I just spoke with @RepRichardNeal, he supports @NYGovCuomo's idea to have states work together to  between states. Cuomo today said price of a ventilator has risen from $25k to $45k as need for life-saving equipment increases and states bid for limited supply.

bedfellows indeed let's take a look at donors over the last 2 decades. 
A few things: @NYGovCuomo says he doesn’t know what this means. Unclear what law covers it. Federal authority is limited to restricting movement of anyone “reasonably believed to be infected with a  disease." And the Nat’l Guard reports to a state’s Gov.  …

"NYRA also joins @NYGovCuomo in extending our deepest gratitude to the first responders, medical professionals and volunteers who continue to operate on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19."
"The UK needs ventilators ... I hope we soon will have enough that we can help other countries" -- Trump has been more responsive to UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson asking him for ventilators than he has been to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 
Cuomo was about to extort 1.1 billion dollars from #NYC residents to support his collapsing medicaid programs. His budget was an absolute mess bc SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK. Then #Coronavirus gave @NYGovCuomo the means to extort the Federal govt instead.  …

. @NyGovCuomo frees more than 1,000 inmates in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. "Wherever we can get people out of jails, out of prisons, now, we are." 
@NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo are both clowns. Just last week these guys had the NYC schools open. Federal gov’t stepped in behind the scenes and forced them to close. Now all of a sudden Cuomo acting like a Corona hero to market his next campaign. Frauds...I hate both!

Let me say this again. Ventilators most critical equipment needed. Other states, even other countries desperately trying to get. Cuomo lost track of what Trump sent to him. His  hurting other states because he took extra that others needed! Don't get me started...
So put NY on total lockdown..only way to stop the spread
Cuomo has been throwing money at special interests, and filling his pockets instead of doing the right things for his state. He is extremely  De blasio too! Couple of crooks!

And they're cashing in big-time right now. It's #Corruption of the highest order.
Has there ever been anything Trump has done as President that was handled in the way of “how it works”?
Same with Italy. 4 years of reporting about hospital system in collapse. Now it's all on this illness.
I've been sitting in my house for 15 days at this point... What else do you want us New Yorkers to do you A-HOLE? Let the big boys like @NYGovCuomo handle this. TY.

Hey Biden supporters! Biden has been accused of RAPE, he is a pathological liar, and he has a really bad record. On top of all that, he seems to be losing his mind. Wake up or we are going to have 4 more years of Trump.

I don’t understand what @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor are waiting for?
IRL the top 1% make over ~$550,000 per year in NYS and pay only very slightly higher rates than everyone else (and got huge trump tax cuts). Probably about 180,000 people live in top 1% households. 72 billionaires live in NYC

@NYGovCuomo So you’ve had your ventilators this entire time. 
BIG factcheck of @NYGovCuomo. He appointed the Medicaid Redesign Team to make $2.5 billion in cuts. They met on Feb 11 & March 19. At the 3/19 meeting, the Gov's MRT voted to slash $400 mil in hospital funding, totally separate from federal COVID relief.  …
The virus is what it is. But we have a grown-up in charge in NY

Bernie Sanders dropping out wouldn’t cancel downballot elections
Good point. Tax wealth not 
You realize that downballot elections would still take place, correct?
I think @NYGovCuomo is officially my American dad Who else feels like he’s their internet / public health dad Every time he finishes a briefing I feel all secure. It’s very calming and reassuring.
I am joining the movement to call on @NYGovCuomo and @GavinNewsom to grant #ClemencyNow to elders and others vulnerable to #COVID19.This is a public health crisis and it's beyond time to #LetThemGo 
The president doesn't think it'll take much to enforce a quarantine on the NYC area. Says he's not talking about closing the subways. He thinks the people of NYC will "understand better than anybody and they'll be great." Says he'll speak to @NYGovCuomo about it later.
Governor Cuomo got caught trying to pull a Puerto Rico in New York.

Trump says he’a looking into a possible quarantine, in “NY, parts of CT, and parts of NJ. It will be for a short period of time if at all.” But @NYGovCuomo says he doesn’t like the sound of that 
“I don’t know how you raise taxes on people who are out of work and their businesses are closed. I don’t know how you do that now.” - @NYGovCuomo on calls to raise taxes on wealthy to deal with #coronavirus outbreak
Hmmm....a country’s leader ( @realDonaldTrump), who lies to the country he’s suppose to lead, now wants to impose a quarantine on a specific group of people - Hitler did that too in the 30’s/40’s. It was called the ghetto. And then millions died. @NYGovCuomo
UPDATE: @NYGovCuomo says an executive order will be issued requiring hospitals to allow at least one person to  a woman as she gives birth. Officials: hospitals had been ignoring earlier guidance. Several had banned spouses / partners from L/D wards.
Cuomo on Trump's possible quarantine/travel restrictions on New York: "From a medical point of view I don’t know what you would be  Not sure what he's not understanding. Dr. Fauci said cutting travel from China helped limit spread. Same applies to NY now.
What it means is Individual 1 is jealous of the accolades Gov. Cuomo has received for the exemplary way he has handled the COVID crisis in his state. And ID-1 will do *anything* to slow that momentum and point the public appreciation lens toward himself.

Where is the $420million/yr corporate welfare film&TV tax incentive money going? Largest incentive program in the country. That money was budgeted. Where is it going? What about all of the other @EmpireStateDev 
From afar, Andrew Cuomo seems to be a very impressive individual. Handling extremely difficult times in New York with great calm and authority. Doesn’t take any sh*t from you know who either. Is it too late for him to run?
Someone asks @NYGovCuomo about his "Medicaid Redesign Team" proposing $400 mil in cuts to NY public hospitals during a crisis. Cuomo answers pointing to the federal bill, saying the hospitals are doing "better than anyone else." But the MRT started before Coronavirus…?
Pres. Trump says he is considering an "enforceable" quarantine in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, but Gov. Cuomo says, "I don't even know what that means"  
"We have no money," @NYGovCuomo on budget woes in NY.
Dr. Fauci has been "so kind and helpful," says @NYGovCuomo, who receives advice from Fauci day and night. I call him late at night. I call him in the middle of the night ... he's been really a friend to me personally and the state of New York." 
Biden needs to drop out. He is a sexual assaulter and has no place running for President. And that’s not even mentioning his godawful record in Congress passing neocon fiscal and foreign policy that hurt Americans for decades or the fact that he is in steep cognitive decline.
It’s all in now.. NYC Governor @NYGovCuomo says they have everything they need.. If the individual hospitals are short on anything.. It’s a break down in delivery.. My prayers for New York ..
Really appreciated @NYGovCuomo’s statement just now about finding the good moments and getting to spend time with family that he never otherwise would’ve had. Important sentiment, especially as a note to the honest, factual briefing that preceded it.

Notice also the small bits of modeling: Cuomo speaks to the country and no officials are within 6 feet of him, or each other. The reporters are a safe distance from him and each other.
Sir, I am watching from the UK. You are what New York need right now. Calm, rational and honest. God bless you and all your citizens
Last night on @allinwithchris, @NYGovCuomo claimed he isn't trying to rollback bail reform, just do some "fine tuning." This is disingenuous. The Gov.'s proposals would GUT bail reform and subject thousands more people to pretrial jailing. Do not be fooled.  …
Cuomo denies speaking to Trump about possible NY quarantine, as President just claimed. Cuomo: “I don’t even know what that means”
. @BilldeBlasio stuffed 600,000 illegal aliens into NYC w/ God knows what diseases He & @NYGovCuomo allowed tens of thousands to travel between China and Chinatown Free movement between NYC & the rest of the world for WEEKS Now NYC is the #Coronavirus epicenter of the world
Where can I mail my 2 CPAP machines? Sanje Gupta said they can be used as a bridge to stall use of ventilator. Many...no millions of us have them sitting around our house not being used!
@NYGovCuomo just denied this happened.
I have mad respect for @NYGovCuomo He’s not my governor, but it’s easy to see and appreciate how he’s been working to get ahead of the curve for his citizens while Trump and some other governors are in denial. I hope other officials start to follow Cuomo’s lead. #COVID19
"I've had conversations with my daughters. For hours. We haven't done that before. I've had long conversations with my mother. Even in terrible circumstances, you can find a few rays of light, and people are doing it, and I think we all should." @NYGovCuomo #COVID19 #coronavirus
State of New York delaying presidential primary election to June 23rd from April 28th, announces @NYGovCuomo.
. @NYGovCuomo urging New Yorkers to find the silver lining as we all live under home confinement...says he is getting an opportunity to spend hours talking to his daughters, two of whom are with him in Albany.
Hey @realDonaldTrump You’re the President of ALL 50 states. If You can’t handle it (you can’t) ~ STEP DOWN NOW.
President reverend @NYGovCuomo is now discussing parenting.
Can you be our president please?!?
This is leadership
Can you issue an order for Bernie to suspend his campaign, since he is far behind Biden in the NY polls and we all need to work together to defeat Trump
. @NYGovCuomo says find silver linings in crisis. Notes hours-long conversations with daughter Cara. "They're priceless," he says.
We can't have 50 states  against each other for the same live-saving supplies.  hurts all of us by massively driving up prices. We need a nationwide buying consortium.
. @NYGovCuomo said there needs to be a faster testing process, even as New York has outpaced every other state in testing. He argues millions need to be tested, and tested also for antibodies, in order to restart the economy and allow people who have immunity to go to work.
Cuomo now talking about the failings at the national level. Saying in effect the lack of federal leadership has caused states  against each other, driving up costs. Also calling out the lack of a testing process and failure there on a national level.
Thank you “President” Cuomo. You reduce my anxiety with calmness and truth, exactly what a nation needs from a leader in a time of crisis
No - the presidential primary isn't the only voting taking place. We just need to urge states move to 100% vote by mail.
truth be told, I hear Mario when I hear @NYGovCuomo and i do not think the governor would mind me saying his father would be proud. cc @MrWalterShapiro
Back on subj of soaring ventilator costs, @NYGovCuomo says he doesn't think there's a feasible price gouging claim, citing his experience as Attorney General. Now he suggests that all 50 states form a voluntary buying consortium.
#CoronavirusUpdate: @NYGovCuomo just announced that the federal government approved 4 new temporary medical facilities in NYC: Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, Aqueduct Racetrack, CUNY Staten Island, NY Expo Center. Including Javits, there will now be one in every borough.
100% Vote by mail?
Thank You for remembering the lost souls. @realDonaldTrump has not offered ONE WORD of condolences for ANYONE who has died from COVID-19. Not ONE WORD. #TrumpIsHeartless
As a retired Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT), I was surprised today to hear Gov Cuomo say he's ordered 11,000 Adult Manual Resuscitators (Ambu Bags) for use when NY runs out of mechanical ventilators! He plans on training 10,000 National Guard soilders to squeeze them? 
Really!? SAVING LIVES!? Have u seen the subways PACKED with us essential workers!? How is that social distancing!? Cut the shit and SHUT IT DOWN! #shutdownNYC
Biden is the greater risk. Biden's going to deliver us Trump in November. Also, Biden isn't being much of a leader at the moment proving he's not up to the task of being president.
. @NYGovCuomo failed to act decisively early on to stem the #coronavirus epidemic. Now he adds to the misery and risk of New Yorkers by releasing over a thousand criminals who I doubt respect quarantines and social distancing. #CoronavirusNewYork  …
He’s cutting Medicaid, healthcare benefits, and refusing to raise taxes on the ultra wealthy to keep NY 
I'm deeply saddened that we have lost 728 New Yorkers to Coronavirus. We are fighting to save every life. You must help by following all health protocols. We ALL have a role to play to reduce the spread of this virus. Help us save lives.
Biden should be the bigger man and drop out to save lives!!!
We are working on three dedicated COVID-only hospitals. We will prepare 600+ beds for the treatment of coronavirus patients. It is the safest thing to do.
Yeah, I agree, Bernie is the only nominee we need with all the bullshit that’s happening. I think it’s time for Biden to drop out!
@NYGovCuomo more than 10,000 independent pharmacies provide home delivery. Most of NY’s independents and @KinneyDrugs, a NY based chain, have been doing so for years despite the obstacles PBMs have created around doing so. We’re ready to talk! @melissadderosa @RichAzzopardi
>> @NYGovCuomo: "Yes, death is inevitable for all of us. Just not today, right? That's the point." Slowing the spread prevents deaths.
. @NYGovCuomo says number of deaths in New York now 728, up from 519. 
BREAKING: @NYGovCuomo has just postponed the April 28 NY presidential primary to June 23. It will now  with the June 23 federal and state primaries. 
It is pretty clear who the nominee is. I think they should just end the primaries for everyone's safety
Cuomo: Number of daily new hospital admissions has decreased. 
Any chance we could get ~I DONT KNOW~ a new candidate in June?... (You.) #DraftCuomo 
. @NYGovCuomo says total number of people tested is now 155,934. 52,318 people have tested positive for the #coronavirus in New 
#BernieSanders needs to drop out. He is putting the public at risk.
Please let this be the death knell for Bernie's campaign so we all can move on with #Biden as the nominee
May we all vote by mail please?
How @NYGovCuomo continues day after day with his calm & steady LEADERSHIP after having to deal with The Malignant Narcissist @realDonaldTrump is a testament to how AMAZING he is.
NEW: We will move our presidential primary to June 23rd. Public health is our number one priority and we will carry out this vital democratic process at a safer date.
NEW: @NYGovCuomo announces the state’s primary has been delayed until June 23rd #coronavirus
. @NYGovCuomo is moving it's primary to June. Delaying tax deadline until July
It is outrageous that @NYGovCuomo was pushing Medicaid cuts to begin with and it will be even more so if he tries to put them in the state budget during a health crisis. New York must expand health coverage, not cut it.  …
. @NYGovCuomo says April 28th presidential primary is moved to June 23rd alongside congressional and legislative primaries. 
BREAKING: @NYGovCuomo said he has postponed New York’s planned April 28 presidential primary until June 23.  …
JUST IN: @NYGovCuomo says NYS Presidential primary moved from April 28 to June 23. #CoronavirusUpdates
NEW: @NYGovCuomo says New York will delay its April 28th Presidential Primary. Moved to June 23.
Cuomo: We are about to start antibody testing to see if people have already had it.
During COVID crisis, NewYork is not the only State in need of ventilators. While @NYGovCuomo wishes to refurbish his StockPile for future, other states urgent need could be today. Stop Hoarding NY should’ve restored the Ventilators StockPile, after 2009 H1N1 Pandemic 
Yes it was. I worked in @newyorkcity as an ED and ICU nurse It has been a hot mess for a long time the #COVID19 just brought it out in the open the @NewYork government has been robbing the medical system for decades.
. @NYGovCuomo announces another shift: creating hospitals that exclusively treat coronavirus. State is isolating 600 beds in three different sites for this purpose.
Cuomo says there will be a shift to COVID-only hospitals, meaning  of people with different maladies risking getting that infection.
New York moving to COVID-only hospitals - @NYGovCuomo
. @NYGovCuomo's ten-years of austerity budgets has led to crippling inequality. And it has led to the lack of preparedness in our social safety net, specifically in our hospital, school, housing, and criminal justice systems as we now face the #COVID19 pandemic. Pass it on.
THANK You Every Single Day for your LEADERSHIP.
New: @NYGovCuomo announces federal gov’t has approved construction of four more temporary hospitals built by @ArmyCorpsNAD - Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island w 1000 patients/each. NY will have total of 8. Design & construction to start immediately. #COVID19 #Coronavirus
NY is now administering trials of the hydroxychloroquine &  to 1100 patients in NY according to @NYGovCuomo at his press conference today stating he is optimistic like @realDonaldTrump. Let's all hope & pray for the best!
Truth. Transparency. Inspiration. Three things all good leaders should have at all times displayed in @NYGovCuomo PCs: -He consults experts, deals in facts-good & bad -We believe & trust him because he explains how decisions are made -He talks about feelings & gives us courage
From @NYGovCuomo: It’s been just 27 days since first case Schools closed just 10 days ago Overall shutdown only 8 days ago First case in China just 12 weeks ago Consulting with experts on ventilators who have said that if there are no ventilators, use bag valve masks
Aqueduct has been approved as a site for a temporary hospital, @NYGovCuomo just announced.
There is a concern that the CDC guidelines on PPE are not adequately protecting our nurses & doctors. We're aware of the concerns & we're actively looking into it. If the guidelines don’t sufficiently protect our health care professionals, we'll put our own guidelines in place.
NEW: @NYGovCuomo says spoke with @realDonaldTrump. Four new temporary  to Brooklyn, Queens, SI, Bronx. 4000 more beds
Trump and his “Hunches” have been 100% wrong about everything dealing with the CoronaVirus Pandemic. Time to listen to the Dr.’s and Experts who base their Information on Science and Experience. #WorthAShot
"I will greet it with open arms," @NYGovCuomo on hospital ship Comfort arriving on Monday.
Grew up with Mario Cuomo in my home state State House as Lt. Governor and as Governor. He was revered in my house. He would be so proud of his son @andrewcuomo and the job he is doing.
Cuomo is doing a great job. Someone in the WH wants that spotlight to make up for his own inaction. Cuomo is schooling.
“As the coronavirus pandemic grew, Trump had advised his longtime friend to decamp to Deal, where many Syrian Jewish families have large homes on the Atlantic Ocean, saying it would be “safer” than New York City, real estate sources said.”
In You we TRUST
Trump has apparently been advising his wealthy friends to flee  …

New: New York’s COVID-19 apex is still forecasted to be 14-21 days away, says Governor Cuomo, adding state will need about 140,000 beds at the height of the apex.
I have operated BVM and BV on intubated patients. Using them in place of machine ventilators in a mass casualty is a fantasy.
So he can’t help our state, but he dictates to it?
WAIT! I thought the president WAS @NYGovCuomo.
. @NYGovCuomo still saying the apex is 14-21 days away.
The hoax is the president
He’s “considering” while on his trip to VA to kiss the ship bye-bye. At least he’s not on Twitter.
. @NYGovCuomo press conferences are now live on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News(!). That’s gonna drive someone insane. 
Andrew Cuomo! God bless him. How do you thank a guy for providing so many with the gift of calmness and purpose.
At daily briefing on #coronavirus outbreak @NYGovCuomo says ventilators have jumped in price from 25K to 45K since the state started buying them because “they are in such demand”
It’s price gauging. And the way to prevent that is the Defense Production Act. Shortage problem solved.
I totally agree my friend Erin I live in Michigan we need a conservative governor bad state went blue
I don’t even live in NY and think you are amazing. Great job on informing everyone with the TRUTH! I say #CuomoForPresident
Does your back hurt, from carrying the weight of the country, while “Stable Genius” is in his bedroom tweeting? Thank you, for lifting all of us. #DraftCuomo #PresidentCuomo
now @NYGovCuomo says ventilators initially cost $25,000 each and now cost $40,000 each. That's the "free market," without price controls or distribution coordination at the federal level.
Every emergency is unique. Needs are always different. The only similarity is that what is needed is always unexpected. In this case the unexpected need is ventilators.
. @NYGovCuomo says the price of ventilators, because of the demand  has increased from around $25,000 to around $40,000. New York needs 30,000 in the next few weeks, Cuomo said.
Gov. Cuomo says the average length of stay on a ventilator is usually 3-4 days, but with coronavirus, patients are staying on an average of 11-21 days: “They are the necessity in this situation”  
#WHO, how much longer do you plan to continue sleeping with #China? Why don't you talk to #Asia to close the #wetmeatmarkets? Amend the #mistake of lying to the #world and not #warning it in time about 
@NYGovCuomo demonstrating hand ventilators, talking about how they are ordering them as back ups, and STILL begging fed gov for 30K ventilators. "That's what the numerical [worse case scenario models] predict"
Cuomo keeps talking about ventilators. Ventilator ventilator ventilator ventilator ventilator ventilator ventilator ventilator ventilator. Take the ventilators out of storage, you jerk off!
Here it is people... She had no clue what she was talking about.. She didnt care and told everyone EVERYTHING WAS OK to be in the city and congregate in the city... STOP BLAMING TRUMP !! YOUR TDS IS GETTING THE BEST OF YOU...
I Live in NY. Cuomo was 6 Billion in the hole before this all started. This is his way out. You are 100% correct.
Governor @NYGovCuomo is giving a lesson in how ventilators function, and what the manual option looks like if the machine version is not available, demonstrating bag valve masks. The National Guard is being trained to manually operate the bag valves if ventilators are short. 
Seeing @NYGovCuomo giving his daily press conference puts me at ease. Much like my late grandmother described during FDR’s fireside chats. Thank you Gov!
Thank you, thank you. I've learned more watching your briefings than anywhere else. Thank you for pointing out the difference in length of days on ventilators and why this is unprecedented for the emergency manufacturing need. Please share your visuals when you can.

Dear @DNC, Are you going to let @JoeBiden respond to #COVID19 since he is your de facto candidate instead of @NYGovCuomo? Imagine if we had DeSantis leading the charge instead of Trump. Might that seem we were trying to hide something? Like our candidate?

Dr. Brix reveals there are over 2000 ICU beds available not in use currently in NYC, yet because of Cuomo falsely representing actual facts with his fear mongering. Dr Brix pushes back on the false narrative.

Can someone explain to @NYGovCuomo that ‘storage’ and ‘stockpile’ if not synonymous are analogous. Sounds very much like a certain mayor of a certain Caribbean island city hit by a hurricane... while NYC medical staff need ventilators, he’s hoarding them

Right, so you're on the "take our chance with Biden" team. Good luck with that!
Sleazy moves like... corporate media crusade against Bernie, holding primaries under conditions where people don't feel safe voting, letting Biden blatantly lie in debates & refusing to call it out, ignoring Biden's sexual assault allegations, pundit bias in favor of moderates

So let it be written. So let it be done.
If this is true why has my son that an EMT in NYC been told to use a scarf to cover his face when treating patients?
I’m not understanding the technicalities of “Cuomo entering the race”. Biden is not the nominee, has not picked a VP (said it would be a woman), 25th amendment is for actual pres, Biden is on ballots, Cuomo is not + deadlines to reg. W/ states are way past-Does anyone have FACTS?
Wouldn't be shocked if they try to force him at the convention. They'd rather install a candidate than let Bernie have it at this point.
Amazing they had all those ventilators and didn't realize they had them and said they didn't have them, that's a typical @dnc tactic try to blame @realDonaldTrump when they are at fault! @NYGovCuomo & @BilldeBlasio an  !
Wow. I could spend an hour picking you apart. But I'm not wasting my time. And I thank the Lord I gave up my NY residency decades ago!

Worst take since...

. @page88 in @latimes : "Americans can turn to their governors — with Cuomo and Newsom in the lead — to speak the truth, mandate the shutdowns, contradict what passes for pandemic policy under Trump. As Churchill might have said, appeasing a tyrant never ends well."

Cram a candidate down our throats that never won a primary? DP tried that in 68 w/Humphrey. How'd that turn out, Bill? It resulted in a new suffix in the American lexicon for scandals. Looking for a repeat?

Biden should definitely step down but Cuomo ain't it. You think Sanders supporters who've donated tons of their time and money would show up in November if the party just pulled a switch with 27 contests left in the primary? You'll re elect Trump.

"Let's take out a tired starter who's been wobbly" and put in the candidate who is running in 2nd place, who has shown he is ready and willing to lead the country, who is filling the leadership void in both parties every day of the #coronavirus crisis. #Bernie2020 #NeverBiden
So @NYGovCuomo is officially my president until further notice. Do you think I need to notify him? Because it's already been decided by..like... my whole family so....
So glad to see you admit you dgaf about democracy.
The army Corps of Engineers built Cuomo a hospital in three days. That should not have been necessary. Pence had to tell New York hospital staff that they needed to contact the state public-health office to get the equipment needed.
Fredo’s brother @NYGovCuomo is lying. Again.  …
So still gunning for Biden after all we’ve seen, especially as of late? Or is it more a never Bernie kind of thing?
Cuomo had TWO warehouses full of respirators that he didn't know he had. Trump had to TELL HIM about them. So much for the Democrats' next great hope. Another  windbag. An actor.
You realize the DNC has tried to do this with multiple options *in* the race and none of them worked. Please replace Biden. That will surely go over well... #BernieOrGreen

Thank you, President Trump, for delivering ventilators to New York, despite the fact that Cuomo let them sit in a warehouse. Watch the video for yourself. Are you awake, yet? 
Seriously? Does voting mean anything? We voted for our nom in a landslide, in a freaking pandemic! Biden is the embodiment  empathy, & sincerity! Combined with the ability,  & the experience to lead, & most importantly he can win EVERYWHERE! Get 
@NYGovCuomo always lies. For 30 years he has lied to me and  owners in NY.  …
Cuomo is working to cut hospital budgets as we speak. Medicaid too.  …
If Biden fails to get the nomination for whatever reason, Sanders should be the nominee because he will have the delegates.
Cuomo is trying to cut hospital budgets and Medicaid DURING A PANDEMIC. Uninformed centrists are so easily led.  …
Beauty Supply not essential bro @NYGovCuomo??
In reality, @NYGovCuomo’s 2015 state ventilator allocation guidelines permit a ‘triage officer’ to decide who lives or dies. If you’re a blue or yellow, c’est la vie. Irresponsible jackass @ChrisCuomo says Trump OK with elderly dying to protect  …
They are both fighting a tough fight brother, with many different factors. NYC has to enforce this 
TAKE ACTION: I am joining the movement to call on @NYGovCuomo and @GavinNewsom to grant #ClemencyNow to elders and others vulnerable to #COVID19. This is a public health crisis and it is beyond time to #LetThemGo! 
Maher makes something like 10 million a year. He doesn't want to pay his share of taxes.
Agreed, sir. The whole "democracy" thing is such a nuisance.
#CuomoTheThug over ride @BilldeBlasio shelter in place for nyc as a power play because deblasio endorsed Bernie only to put it in place 8vdays later. How many more new Yorkers got the virus due to his fucking ego?
Have that doctor contact @NYGovCuomo. New York State is looking for top medical staff, and we  people who tell the truth - even if the message is not what we want to hear. We deal in truth here in New York State.
As @NYGovCuomo whining like a little girl about ventilators, he's stockpiling them.. what's his deal, now he wants 40k? What's he doing, selling them? You need to watch this guy.. Keep and audit track every one of those machines. I don't trust liberals.
Hi, @NYGovCuomo! The neighbors can't pay the rent!  …
I'm not voting for a Wall Street toady that is not even running. Can you corporate shrill any 
According to Gov. Witmer, those who supply the medical equipment needed have been told by the #Trump administration not to sell/ship to Michigan.
He was gonna run away with it. That's why they needed the corporate puppets to drop out and serve the Oligarchs right before super Tuesday and endorse Biden. You know it's true. That's why EVERY one of them agreed to a contested convention when it looked like he'd win a majority.
No this is not how this shit works....Its step aside Biden Let Bernie take over..
He's cutting hospital budgets because of IDEOLOGICAL REASONS.
dunno if you know this but Cuomo has even fewer delegates
Cuomo has ZERO delegates, Bill. ZERO. You'll have to settle for the one candidate who's actually acted PRESIDENTIAL during the pandemic: Bernie Sanders. Don't like it? Too bad.
Bernie's hundreds of delegates mean nothing to you?
Maybe Harris or Buttigieg? Let's just bring back all the losers and start over. Oh wait, that's not how it works. People can get behind Bernie or watch Joe get his ass kicked.
Dismissing Biden, Sanders is the only one with a mandate by voters to be the nominee.
As an abolitionist, I am pragmatic. I believe that decarceration at this time is possible. I know that decarceration is a moral imperative. We have the resources, the expertise, the will. Advocates have proposed solid plans. We don't have much  …
This is sinister manipulation of words if I’ve ever heard them. Listen to how @NYGovCuomo trip his way though this political deflection, knowing he would have been caught red-handed in another lie if he had done otherwise. 
You mean @BernieSanders I assume
@NYGovCuomo & @GovSisolak need 2 reverse their bans on using it 4 coronavirus. No long term studies r needed when we have recent data from France & our own doctors’ experience over the past month. There is none so blind as he who will not see. They could be sued 4 wrongful death.
He waived hos presidential salary... he does this free. Its the states responsibilty to prepare for this as well them fed steps in when needed. Its not the Feds job to step up and supply for 50 states
Fredo @NYGovCuomo wanting 40k ventilators but as of today the DS still hasn't passed out the 4400 given to him!!! In 2015 he had the opportunity to buy them at a reduced rate and declined!! I think Fredo needs to start getting his state prepared for the next disaster. 
They wanted to blame P Trump for the high rate of deaths from CV in NY. Watch the underperforming duo, to continue lying and blaming @realDonaldTrump for their inefficiency, and lack of leadership.Something is WRONG in  to other cities in .Cuomo and De Blasio=lying 
@POTUS How can these Democrat Governors decide if I can take a medicine or NOT? #IWantMyRightsBack #MyBodyMyChoice @NYGovCuomo @GovWhitmer We HAVE RIGHTS
He doesn’t like @NYGovCuomo that’s why he didn’t move faster. His tunnel vision saw only giving Gov. Cuomo help. His intellect  that it’s the American people that need the equip. He has blood on his hands!
Thanks for putting this together Keith... @NYGovCuomo is the kind of leader you want in a crisis. Raised by two of the finest New Yorkers in history... Mathilda & Mario. Please watch...  …
Wow @NYGovCuomo could you possibly be worse? How many will die because you failed to circulate those ventilators? Don't dare try to blame @realDonaldTrump for YOUR  …
My friend died today. 42 with 2 girls Rise in Power King #COVID19 he didn't have to die. and @NYGovCuomo wants to cut Medicaid #TaxTheRich WE DEMAND IT! Cutting Medicaid is saying you don't care about my friends life! @AQE_NY @citizenactionny @ed_watchdog @ItsShidaB 
Chris @ChrisCuomo your father would be proud of his two sons. @CuomoPrimeTime @NYGovCuomo 
Bernie and Biden are separated by a single-digit percentile.
There is still another candidate in the race who also happens to be the only adult in the room. #BernieBeatsTrump in every poll since 2015. And you know that. Get with the program or admit you want more Trump.
I’m joining the movement to call on @NYGovCuomo & @GavinNewsom to grant #ClemencyNow to elders & others vulnerable to #COVID19. This is a public health crisis & it’s beyond time to #LetThemGo #ClemencyCoast2Coast @RAPPcampaign @CURBprisons @paroleprepny 
Sorry - you break it, you bought it.
It's anti-science to ban effective medication, particularly ones that have been prescribed to humans as long as hydroxychloroquine. Doctor's prescribe medicines off-label all the time. It's a doctor-patient decision, not a govt one.
PPE, VENTILATORS SHOULD BE STOCK PILED AT EVERY HOSPITAL! NURSES SHOULD RECEIVE 50K BONUS, CNAs 25K BONUS! @NYGovCuomo @potus @realdonaldtrump @flotus @ChuckGrassley @SenatorDurbin @4us_workers @michellemalkin @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity @AnnCoulter @NeilMunroDC @LouDobbs 
Hospitals are hot spots Hospitals are hot spots Hospitals are hot spots I’m not hearing this enough on @NYGovCuomo press conferences and steps we are taking to mitigate! We need more drive through testing, triage tents, separation of non-COVID and #COVID suspect pts. More  …
He didn't get destroyed, he got swindled. And even won states including California! There's still roughly half the votes out there, and Biden is failing fast. You choose someone to take Biden's place, or stay with Biden, you lose! Period. Hillary 2.0. Bernie's your best bet!
