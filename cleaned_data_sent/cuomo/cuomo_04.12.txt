Cuomo needs to make Covid-19 look worse than it is this way he can get what he wants from the Federal Government. He also needs to make is seem worse this way it doesn't look like he overreacted. This is all a game of politics!
Cuomo can shove it @realDonaldTrump We aren’t bailing out states because of poor judgement and over spending
But Cuomo INSISTS there’s no politics at play. He INSISTS!
For those praising ⁦ @NYGovCuomo -⁩ He destroyed NY budget BEFORE the Virus. He's now trying to get "unrestricted" Federal Aid supposedly for Virus Relief, BUT it's really to patch the budget shortfall from BEFORE the Virus. NY taxes will be up HUGE!  …
Cuomo is a duplicitous snake. He had a multi billion dollar deficit before this. Now he wants the fed to bail out his failed agenda. He can go scare himself , and I live on Long Island.
Stay home, stay safe! Even on sunny days boys & girls! We can flatten the curve and reunite sooner if you do! @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo 
38,933 Americans are DEAD because of your lack of RESPONSE & NO TESTING Don’t You have a Pandemic to manage? Aren’t you supposed to be LEADING? Thank God we’ve got @NYGovCuomo @GavinNewsom @GovInslee
Donald can’t open up the US economy if he can’t open up NYC, and he can’t open up NYC if he doesn’t provide at least 8 million virus tests for 8 million New Yorkers. @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor have @realDonaldTrump by the balls.
Thank you S Korea for Doing what @realDonaldTrump Refused to do, & intentionally BLOCKED, killing Thousands! @NYGovCuomo Thank you Skorea for saving American lives!  …
Thanks Sweet Lynda I appreciate the Shout Out! F&RIFPB 
So he is holding his ppl hostage? Like a Hunger Strike thing? Well then it’s up to the people of NY to handle.
And you can... as soon as we have widespread testing so we know you dont kill someone doing those things
And there ya have it, more proof that @NYGovCuomo and co. love catering to the interests of the hyper rich. Instead making billionaires pay, he takes action to make sure they can still yacht around during an international pandemic.  …
Comparing the @NYGovCuomo presser to the #TrumpVirusTestingFailure campaign rally presser is  a Ph.D. candidate defending their thesis to a 3rd grader doing an oral book report.
Lmfaooo @NYGovCuomo  …
Perhaps since NY is so highly taxed, someone in state government should have been fiscally responsible. There was already a 6.1 Billion dollar hole in the NY state budget. NY has already received a lot of money from the US Taxpayer that does not live in NY. No more
New York #COVID19 update from @NYGovCuomo: Hospitalization numbers: Emergency rooms occupancy: Intubations: Let’s keep it that way and do our part. New York is now stronger than ever!
Sounds like extortion Governor. It’s not up to the federal government, i.e, the rest of America to pay for your failures in budgeting. Maybe all those “free” handouts were a bad idea. Stop playing politics and using your citizens livelihoods to do it.
Cuomo is holding New York Hostage until he receives Federal Funding. "You want us to reopen? We need funding" I must have forgot how much it cost to tell people they can go back to work.... 
I would be willing to lay a bet on the fact that NYC residents already have herd immunity firmly established. Holding people like this in a pissing contest for federal funding just to BEGIN this impossible amount of testing? At this rate they will be in lockdown until 2024.
. @NYGovCuomo needs to listen to . @nychange members like Chrisdeilyn Dominguez who are calling on him to #CancelRent since we #cantpaymay or we will go on 
Facts,  Cuomo vs. Lies, deceitfulness, apathy: Trump

Cut myself for the first time in a long time tonight. I actually resorted to old trauma tactics to numb the pain this has caused. I have spent 4 weeks trying to get help from @nyslabor and @nygovcuomo. I am exhausted & devastated & terrified. Goodnight, Twitter. I’m done for now.
Only because you and @NYGovCuomo are inflating numbers for federal funding

Never fails to amaze me how the wealthiest places--from NYC to our entire country--can be so deeply in debt/cash poor. I assume that every extra dollar has gone into some creep's back pocket. We get the skimpy post-graft leftovers. Isn't that always the way? How can we stop it??
@NYGovCuomo has no shame. His state was billions in debt before this. He’s trying to get over on the federal government. He’s a weasel.
I stand with @NYGovCuomo
Cuomo has no leverage. NY is solid blue.
‘We don’t have a king — we have a president’ — NY Gov. Cuomo rebuked Pres. Trump’s assertion that  has ‘total’ authority

The people of NY need to TAKE BACK THEIR STATE.
Cuomo losing his lustre, I'll bet. These Dems conveniently forget what this Nation was founded upon. The people haven't forgotten and will remember, again, on Nov. 3rd.
Maybe he should use that $30 billion he sneaked into the NY budget for "climate change initiatives" - including putting a huge number of windmills in NY harbor (which would kill thousands of birds, by the way)!
Combo of presidents Article II powers, federal govt's enumerated Article 1 sec 8  power & National Emergencies Act... President could make it quite difficult for Gov. " God didn't do that".

@NYGovCuomo's plan to release a TINY number of incarcerated ppl within 90 days of their release excludes 98% of elders. We won't be appeased by this paltry symbolic gesture. We stand strong in our demand that he listen experts & grant BROAD releases to save lives.

"How does this situation get worse, and get worse quickly?," says NY Gov. Cuomo. "If you politicize all that emotion. We cannot go there."

So Cuomo has time to attend a Clinton Global Initiative Event, and yet he Bitch's at the President for not doing enough... Good to know..
Please, if you haven’t seen it, watch today’s @NYGovCuomo Covid press briefing. He actually talks about Covid-19, testing and how to move forward. I have no idea what trumps briefing was about. Crazy AF messed up.

I would like to request that @NYGovCuomo adds this as a daily reminder for all of us working remotely. It would be a nice touch to add an Upstate version - which also included the month.

Trump said it was the governors problem to solve. Not his. So they should be covering the governors. Not him.
There is no reason to keep airing his updates. NY is not relevant to the 49 other states. Its disgusting.
I've been quite surprised by the number of out of state friends and relatives who are glued to the daily NY state briefings. Because it's a half hour of clear, coherent updates, illustrated with good narrative, based on  of science and tough but firm decision-making.
The @NYGovCuomo briefings are effectively the antithesis, if not actual counter programming (which is impossible given how randomly they schedule the WH briefings and how late they usually start)
I haven't been there since '99. Looks like it's gonna be awhile. Thank God. I'm sorry you're not in NY. Our Governor is AWESOME. What a pity that @NYGovCuomo isn't Potus because we wouldn't be in this mess. #ArrestTrumpSaveLives

Besides, president Newsom has better ring to it.
I call bullshit. He is the only governor that has been honest,  and maintained a tiny sense of humor so as not to panic everyone in a city that has been to hell. I leader that TELLS THE TRUTH IS PRICELESS.

Laura needs to move to Moscow.
NY Gov @NYGovCuomo was LYING THE WHOLE TIME! His lack of ventilators was HIS OWN DOING. IN 2015, his own Health Advisors told him he needed 15,750 ventilators for a possible pandemic. He spent $750 million on a failed solar farm instead? Typical DEMOCRAT; NOT USING LOGIC?
I call @NYGovCuomo's media briefings #LessonsInLeadership in times of crisis & beyond. I fervently take notes. The lessons I got today were: 1. Why we need more #Testing before opening business? 2. Leadership & #Empathy. 3. Tone matters in #crisis. 4. It's not about #politics.  
So @NYGovCuomo is Saying TRUMP won't Help Save lives!! He's BEGGED TRUMP non stop to PLEASE HELP NEW YORK ( & all america) FIGHT CORONA with TESTING & Trump REFUSES!! Why?!?! Testing is the only thing that's stopped Corona in Germany, SKorea, Iceland.. why won't Trump Help?  …

Well gee, maybe he should talk to NEW ZEALAND instead.
It’s wedding season. A lot of people were planning to get married anyway.
Gov Cuomo, the  chair of the National Governors Association, said today the NGA sent a letter to Congress asking for $500,000,000 dollars to fund their State Governments. Does this include Abortions? Funds for Sanctuary Cities? Funds illegal alien Drivers Licenses? BULL! 
It’s a win win, we’re all free.
Having next of kin rights can be very important, especially during a pandemic.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar: "Everyone is not going to be happy with everything these governors do. I think it was Andrew Cuomo who said 'sure I'm not making you happy, if you're mad call me.'... Does the president of the United States say that? No." 
COVID-19 is a double whammy for incarcerated NY'ers—kills people of color at higher rates & people of color are incarcerated at higher rates. So it couldn't be more clear that @NYGovCuomo doesn't care about Black &  as he refuses to release those in his prisons

Aww.. that's sweet. Thank you, Gov Cuomo! Can you also help me find a husband? I'd need an executive order for that. A non-douche husband this time.
Are the new spouses allowed to stand next to each other and kiss? Or do they have to kiss through a mask? Waiting for your next Executive Order telling married people they can’t be within 6 feet of each other #reopenNY #tyrant
President Andrew @NYGovCuomo doing his best for all New Yorkers
On one level we all already know it’s time. This pandemic just helped with our realization of it. Now we’re forced to be with each other with no distractions.

If she doesn’t know, now she knows.
You should be our president!
You're a good man. Thanks for leading the nation during this time—leadership is sorely missing from some quarters.

Gov. Cuomo says “The majority of Americans choose safety over liberty” What say you!
Testing is different than being able to process the tests/samples. In order to process these samples we need reagents (special chemicals) to separate the virus RNA if there is one in the sample. This is microbiology 101. These reagents are in backorder  from China.
Didn’t @NYGovCuomo implement a mask in public rule for all of NYS? #askmymayor.

I’ve got an important message to share. I love @NYGovCuomo That’s it. Carry on.
Well, maybe @NYGovCuomo should give that unity speech to @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer because their only agenda is bringing @realDonaldTrump down. They are spiteful and not working together

He's calling out their playbook.
As a resident of NJ who is based out of Manhattan I think you're doing a great job. And when the states you assembled  their own country I am ready for it :)
So in a press conference just now @NYGovCuomo again says the state is closed until NY receives federal funding. (He’s facing at least a $15 Billion deficit.) This statewide closure is starting to feel like a high-stakes hostage situation. It’s political.

. @NYGovCuomo says the federal government sent 1.5 million cloth face masks to New York State, which will be distributed based on need. New order requiring they be worn went into effect last night.
We asked the top 50 labs in NYS what they would need to double their testing. They all said the same thing: They need more chemical reagents. We need the federal government to oversee the supply chain and help get labs what they need.
not now son, President Cuomo is giving his daily press conference
All I hear @NYGovCuomo saying is “we need, we need, we need”. Stop whining and let NY’ers get back to work. We’ll take it from here. #ReOpenNYS #endthelockdown
“Happy days are not here again,” says @NYGovCuomo, despite hospitalizations, ICU admissions and intubations all trending down. Still 540 deaths yesterday, and almost 2,000 *new* hospital admissions. Says under normal conditions, "this would be devastating news."
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that 540 people in the state died over the past 24 hours from coronavirus. Live updates:  
Interesting: @NYGovCuomo says he surveyed 50 labs in New York and asked what was stopping them from expanding testing capacity. Most labs said the logjam was the inability to get more "reagents," which are special chemicals needed to run a test.
Why is testing so important? -Testing is how you monitor the rate of infection. -Testing is how we find people with the virus and trace their contacts. The challenge is to bring testing up to scale.
Cuomo is so good at explaining what is going wrong with the federal response. This situation with regard to reagents is abominable. We have labs that could be doubling their testing but can't get reagents because the Trump administration WON'T LET THEM.
. @NYGovCuomo giving a lecture, for several days now, on details of testing and its challenges. Good example of how Cuomo can get into the weeds on policy, both to the delight of some (and the sincere aggravation of others).
There are almost 1000 people infected in NY prisons (staff and people incarcerated). These numbers are only going to get worse, and yet Gov. Cuomo hasn't given a single reprieve  even though he has the absolute authority to do it. He is responsible for this.  …
"The challenge is now bringing this up to scale," @NYGovCuomo says of testing in order to reopen. Some perspective: New York has outpaced other states in testing: More than 500K tests in one month. That's still just 2.5% of NY's total population.
In one part he said “I said thank you many times, what do you want?” “A Bouquet of flowers?”
Listen up @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio *THIS* is what a REAL Governor & REAL Leadership looks like! He knows how to govern his state and doesn’t wait on or blame the federal government! Meet fabulous @tatereeves! He knows how to RUN HIS 
Except of course don’t think about the hundreds of staff per school that would be at risk plus kids can easily spread COVID.
So we need an “army” to do contact tracing. We have one: college/grad students. Enlist them to do post-positive interviews, by phone, to trace each person the infected came into contact with. Offer students loan forgiveness/scholarships/credits. Students are already tech savvy.
Exactly, Germany's numbers are going back up. You relax restrictions too early this will happen in NY  …
Yassss @NYGovCuomo drag him! 
Remember: We still have about 2,000 new COVID hospitalizations daily. And we lost 540 New Yorkers yesterday. That is a soul-crushing loss. When you feel tired of social distancing, think of those we lost. That's what's at stake here.
In more "sobering news," @NYGovCuomo announced 2,000 new hospital admissions, and that 540 people died Friday in the state from #coronavirus. 36 of those 540 deaths happened in nursing homes, which Cuomo called the "feeding frenzy" for 
"Testing informs the calibration" of reopening measures and how they're affecting infection rates, @NYGovCuomo says.

NEW/BREAKING: 540 deaths in last 24 hours in NY, per @NYGovCuomo. Down from 630 deaths, in previous 24 hour period, reported on Friday.
At @NYGovCuomo daily briefing, first fact, it is Saturday. Second fact, hospitalizations are down. Are we past apex? Still a question, but things are looking...better.

During the pandemic, the media has taken their “hurricane while a Republican is President” template to the extreme. What’s really jarring is that they’ve also been able to use their “disaster under Democrat” template for Cuomo, despite NY having by far the most cases.
" @NYGovCuomo still ha[s] a chance to protect people incarcerated in state prisons by releasing the most vulnerable – anything less would demonstrate an utter lack  - @TMLuongo. #ClemencyNow  …
Bad Morning @NYGovCuomo Do you understand that you are chasing New Yorkers out of NYS in droves? Do you not care? 6b in the whole is a huge number. Now you want a federal bailout? You sir are a disgrace.
Call 518-730-4619 TODAY to demand @NYGovCuomo grant #ClemencyNow to protect not only NY inmates, but  and families surrounding prisons that are at high risk of infection.  …
LMAO, "mask monitor" We can't make this crap up so the Dems did it for us
I do not know why New Yorkers like Governor Cuomo. Look back at his record. It’s a DISASTER!! People are fleeing NY because of him!
I got yelled at by the store mask monitor yesterday for not appropriately wearing my mask (it slipped right below my nose) She was literally walking around checking customers and scolding them re masks, not enough distance, etc!
Why did you promise @somedayboy a dm about his claim then nothing @NYSLabor @NYGovCuomo If you promise Keep your promise  …
So we are suppose to jump the shark that @NYGovCuomo is a Rocket Scientist who  the most deadly of challenges. @JoeBiden is a joke, but this guy isn't. And naive Dems fall for  …
The pace in testing won’t reach what it must for us to be safe. I follow @NYGovCuomo’s lead.
Thx friend ..my daily dose of truths, empathy & leadership .. Hope you are well ..Stay well We have an election to WIN
This man @NYGovCuomo is incredible. We need him as president, and I’m ok if he runs the country from NY
Here in NY we have @NYGovCuomo and he won’t be pushed around by @realDonaldTrump thank god
This analysis of @realDonaldTrump by an #angrygrandma is 2nd only to @NYGovCuomo takedown on 4/17. Squandering the power and potential of Federal resources to avoid responsibility ...
Ha!! That would be great!!
. @NYSLabor Why do you promise to answer people and then don’t. Hey @NYGovCuomo if @NYSLabor promise a dm they should follow through
Thank you for your leadership #NewYorkTough 
My guess: When epidemiologists talk about Ebola success in a region, it’s based on how much time has passed since the last known active infection. I’m going to ask a few experts what COVID-19 “success” might look like. I suspect it will require continued robust testing.
Every day I wake up and wonder: which sweatpants will I wear? and what time will @NYGovCuomo hold his press conference today?
Anyone out there remember when @NYGovCuomo said, "America was never that great"? All we have heard from Cuomo is "I want...I need...Can you get?...Do you have?" No he seems to want @realDonaldTrump to get New York open again. Do your job,  …

I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GREAT IDEA @realDonaldTrump I'D BE PROUD TO WEAR THIS MASK NOT JUST IN NY @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor BUT ANYWHERE MAGAKAG 
Odd how New York and New Jersey account for more than 50% of total Corona deaths in this country. Anybody taking a close look at these figures? Truth be told!! @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @IngrahamAngle @SpyGateDown 
As @NYGovCuomo said maybe Trump should get up and go to work instead of watching TV
Look at Italy. Two weeks ago, people were celebrating what appeared to be an apex but they plateaued. There has been no descent and number of deaths remain high. God bless you, sir. It has to be taking its toll on you personally. You are an inspiration to us all.
I’d like to report Chris Cuomo
A dumb @realDonaldTrump vs a smart @NYGovCuomo. Words  Cuomo uses big boy words, imagine a public official with an actual vocabulary that spans more than adjectives ending in -ly.  …
Governor Cuomo, Congresswoman Slaughter and Amtrak Open New Rochester Rail Station  via @nygovcuomo Big Problem, they attempted to use me in their Fraud & Criminal Conspiracy. Is it a crime yet?
Remember that @realDonaldTrump wants/needs people to die. He deliberately and publicly refuses to support governors so he can distance himself as the body count continues to grow. He understands the leadership of @GovWhitmer @NYGovCuomo et al amplifes his grotesque failures.
Sorry @NYGovCuomo this taxpayer owes you nothing. Why should I bail out your state because it was poorly managed?  …

Ive said the same thing for over a week. @NYGovCuomo is running a rouse on the Fed. Gvmt. Cuomo is padding NY’s COVID19 death count with unrelated deaths to get more Federal #MEDICARE $$He’s trying to fix #NewYork’s long-standing revenue problem under the guise of #COVID19.

F'ing sad. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers literally begging for help. I got trolled yesterday for tweeting that if @NYGovCuomo doesn't have a plan to restart economy, he needs to have one for getting unemployment pay to people. That's his job. & the right thing to do.  …
And I think he is genuine. You can't fake that. The others seem more tense. Jesse is Jesse. I admire that authenticity.
Good Morning Patriots!! Notice ABC’s narrativePresident Trump is picking a fight. WRONG! Cuomo, has been whining for weeks about not getting what’s needed, yet much goes unused & recently he’s given ventilators to other states, all to make Trump look bad and himself look good 
Spot onNick! In the last 6 wks the @LincolnEM residents have exhibited dedication, adaptability and a downright fearlessness to a degree that far exceeds what could have been taught or modeled. We and the  will forever be indebted to them. @NYGovCuomo 
I love @NYGovCuomo Thanks for all you have done for NY and all you do to show the country what a leader looks like!! NY TOUGH goes a very long way in helping save lives and helping to plan how to reopen when it is safe. Your response to the president yesterday
Trump has been doing a great job. If not for him things would be far worse. Even Gov. Cuomo said: “But have we lost anyone because we didn’t have a bed, or we didn’t have a ventilator, or we didn’t have health care staff? No. People we lost are the people we couldn't save.”
I imagine this was taken after his tantrum about @NYGovCuomo ... Baby needs a nap after that.
. @NYGovCuomo says Trump is passing the buck on #COVIIDtesting without passing the 
Reality is that I think NYC government officials, aka: especially @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo (atleast he explains a lot), did a horrible job containing this virus. They didn’t close the parks, they didn’t close mass transit, and they haven’t enforced anything. Outside NYC tristate
Bill DeBlasio wanting a 7 billion dollar bailout from Federal Government. For years he has managed city funds like a drunken sailor on leave. ThriveNYC...Prime example of his frivolous mismanagement. Where’d the money go? @realDonaldTrump @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @TuckerCarlson
Where is this action from @NYGovCuomo? New York needs to follow Washington's lead and stop all water shutoffs in New York state/restore service universally/waive late fees.  …
When NJ gov Phil Murphy admitted that he ignored the Bill of Rights in fealty to “data and science,” he defined this crucial moment. Politicians like Murphy and Cuomo can hide behind “science!” to defend any unconstitutional tactic they desire:  …
Pelosi & Gov Cuomo are singing the same song. They want more money for hospitals.& do not have the regular business owner or their employees on their mind. President Trump fired back at Cuomo & told him to  & do his job, we have given NY more than any other state 
The feud between @realDonaldTrump and @NYGovCuomo is just so pathetic, inappropriate and detrimental amidst the global tragedy of #Covid_19 Who are you backing? @WHO

Will a reporter please ask @NYGovCuomo about people dying from other issues, but the cause of death being classified as "covid-19"...even though the deceased hasn't been tested for the virus? C'mon...he holds daily press conferences. #WeThePeople deserve to know!
Remember illegal aliens (law breakers) VOTE because dem's cheat to win elections- -public record of charges/arrests.

why are you guys still pretending Cuomo is isolated? Have I missed your apology or correction?

It’s all #Cuomo fault! He bankrupted #NewYork with his bad policy’s! He allowed 15 hospitals to close! He chose to care for #IllegalAliens then the citizens of NY! Cuomo is a horrible man! @realDonaldTrump don’t bail NY out he created this mess!  …

Cuomo was running a massive $6.1 billion budget deficit BEFORE the outbreak of the coronavirus. And this is why he’s demanding a federal bailout with no strings attached.  …
We won’t. This pandemic shows us just how dangerous it is to ignore voting. In the past you could usually say elected officials didn’t mess with your life that much. It’s time for the silent majority to take back our country.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Thursday announced at a press conference that he will extend the shutdown of his state until May 15, urging New Yorkers to remain in their homes for another 30 days as the coronavirus crisis continues. 
Dear @NYGovCuomo NY wants to run the country so you can start by practicing fiscal responsibility! No bailouts just learning to spend only what you earn. Perhaps a good start would be exporting all those illegal aliens you spend so much on.  …
My day  of stopping what I’m doing to watch @NYGovCuomo daily briefing (even tho I don’t live in NY anymore) & turning @cnn off for Trump’s daily #coronaTaskFarce (not a typo) it’s like Cuomo is Superman including trumps inability to articulate   …

Good morning Twitter Peeps. Today’s shout out goes to @NYGovCuomo for bringing it yesterday against Trump. I salute you Sir! I NY!
@NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor Univ of WA does the IHME model. It's *one of the models that the CDC looks at. Cuomo falsely claimed the White House 'does' that model, they don't. *Both Dr Birx and Fauci said in March the reality on the ground wasn't matching the IHME inflated predictions
43 states have ‘stay at home’ orders. @realDonaldTrump tweeted about liberation for only 3 of them. Have those protesters wondered why he did not tweet about the other 40 states ? Nope, I didn’t forget about the fight he’s picked with @NYGovCuomo 
He's  He's not doing his job. He's lying constantly, in very obvious and easily disproven ways. He's disrespectful. Can you seriously deny any of this?

“First of all, if he’s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work right?” @NYGovCuomo said. 
Hi i agree . that's not easy . my Brother lives there and i love it there California will be back ?pray for him .
@NYGovCuomo wants unrestricted aid from the taxpayers to fill the $6.1 billion hole in this years’ budget — that’s another reason why NY inflates it’s #COVID19 death counts...
How did he do it without any medication? #RemoveCuomoNOW
New York's governor Andrew Cuomo has accused Donald Trump of failing to provide enough funding to states during the #coronavirus pandemic, saying the president is "passing the buck without bucks". To read more about #COVID19 in the US, click here:

Trump admitted he intentionally IGNORED the needs of NEW YORK and as a result many have died. HIS TWEET IS EVIDENCE  negligence and abuse of power. THIS IS CRIMINALITY which CONGRESS MUST ADDRESS.
I am sure @realDonaldTrump has done more work than the whole @NYGovCuomo family put together in their lifetime.

Lowes... Tru-Value.  given up on @HomeDepot. Their customer service was shite long before coronavirus.
Oh no every time @NYGovCuomo speaks, Trump shrinks just that litttle bit more. Not enough to ever go away though, just more whining and whining and whining from @POTUS
Don't pass the buck, pass the bucks to the states! @NYGovCuomo is leading the country now, Donald. I live in California and I watch Cuomo's press conference EVERY day! He makes sense. You don't. Your pressers are  waste of time, Donald Are you on drugs? 
Never. Ever.
NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo: "You're not going to hear any day soon it's over, the nightmare ends and we wake up. It's going to be incremental and we have to be smart as we do this." 
Right? Cover him in clips instead. Show they’re whole pressers. He’d hate that.
The news networks can thwart Trump: Cover sane governors with all the fanfare they bring to those lie-fests at the White House. There's literally nobody telling them they can't. Cover Biden, too. Equal time. Equal energy. Failure to do it makes  in the death toll.
Wanna explain why the big govt democrats @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo are silent on canceling rent and forgiving student loans? #donors ?

I want to thank @NYGovCuomo for his awesome response yesterday to @realDonaldTrump Twitte. That was the most intelligent and entertaining response I have ever heard from a politician in my entire life. #COVID19 #cuomo
4. In fact, if there’s any immediate reform that is needed NOW is to get @realDonaldTrump out. He is so kiddish, busy apportioning blame instead of thinking through his national strategy. As @NYGovCuomo said, @realDonaldTrump needs to read the Constitution & WORK.
The delight in Donald Trump's face when he speaks of people as his black, his Latinos and his ban of Muslims, chasing brown/black refugees immigrants like animals putting children in cages, shithole countries, the puzzle is done folk #WhyImNotVotingForTrump
I'd tell you to prepare to be disappointed but I can see your life has already prepared you for disappointment.
@NYGovCuomo Cuomo is one of the few I watch every day to get actual credible updates on the whole cluster fuck we find ourselves in. He's far more reliable than the douche bag in the White House.

One last thought for the night. It’s amazing how the press treats the crazy high number of cases/deaths in NYC as an inevitable crisis that Cuomo is  but the high number of cases in the US as avoidable and Trump’s fault
Tens of thousands of Americans have died & thousands of Americansnationwide are hospitalized some taking their last breath..FamiliesBusinesses Communitiesare suffering while the WHouse Occupant is attempting to incite harm & stir chaos during this Coronavirus

Good grief @NYGovCuomo - do you realize how much you talk about @POTUS @realDonaldTrump? It’s like every other word, breath, sentence and punctuation. If I didn’t love him, I’d be sick of him after listening to you! #cuomobriefing #dude #getalife #youllneverbepresident
I think you don’t fully grasp 21st-century criminal law: everything you do is a technically illegal, but that’s OK because we’re 100% safe leaving it up to prosecutors who to go after. So not to worry—they won’t prosecute you unless you, y’know, step out of line.

Absolute best thing I’ve heard all day: “I don't know, what am I supposed to do, send a bouquet of flowers?” —-Andrew Cuomo, responding to Trump’s criticism that he hasn’t shown enough gratitude #Burn
@NYGovCuomo has issued an Exec Order directing all public & private labs in NY to coordinate w/the State Dept of Health to ensure prioritizing diagnostic testing for public health & restarting the economy. What did trump do today? Rage tweeted like a child Cuomo wins every time  …
Giving all of us a master class in leadership.
Nobody does that better than Governor Cuomo. He crushed him so badly with fact and action.
How is the guy with the highest death toll a "great leader"? I don't get the sanctification of Cuomo at all.
Counting down the days til @NYGovCuomo @NYGov opens up BARNS & I can hug my bay again. Some of us aren't lucky enough to have a boyfriend, husband, or dog during all this, so if you have any one of those make sure you hug them extra tight for 
How’d I miss @NYGovCuomo on @HowardStern? Listing to replay now. This is awesome! Good for him - even more respect for my gov for going on the show. Also, love that Howard was trying to play matchmaker with @rqui and the gov.
I listened to @NYGovCuomo's speech this evening. My favorite part was when he told Donald Trump, "I don't need you to tell me I'm the Governor of New York." Cuomo's obviously smarter, sharper, and tougher.  …

@seanhannity is only upset because @NYGovCuomo is breaking through the @FoxNews propaganda and telling Americans the truth. And Americans are listening. They can tell b.s. from honesty.
I live in this $hithole Cuomo created and I can tell you, we don’t deserve a penny!
We know his briefings are the same time daily. I suggest democrats plan a briefing of their own 1 minute before his and go for a half an hour. Better yet, @NYGovCuomo should start his 1 minute before trump. Let’s see who get higher ratings.  …

I guess @SenDuckworth is deaf. Because @NYGovCuomo said that abyone that needed a ventilatir got one. You should be kicked off recovery team. You will be useless because your TDS is too far gone to  something good for America.
Well done @NYGovCuomo for stating what someone needs to have said to and in relation to @realDonaldTrump Trump's actions or inaction has directly resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans enabled by @GOPSomeone needs to stand up for them, Cuomo just did.  …
I love @NYGovCuomo so much, I would donate my life savings for him to be president. All -$30,000 of my credit card debt to his campaign.
. @NYGovCuomo is no hero. He's self serving, & can go f*ck himself sideways. Who does he think gives life to NY? His cronies on Wall Street? No--the hardworking people who he's pretending don't exist. He's willing to starve  members.  …
Love you Sandy
. @NYGovCuomo Stop your public attacks and politicizing. Is your brother Chris Cuomo putting pressure on you because you admitted publicly that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been responsive to your needs every time? Make a phone call and stop the smears! Be safe for all our family.
New York reported 630 deaths today, but there are signs of hope as hospitalizations drop. Still, @NYGovCuomo says “it’s not over.” @Tom_Winter breaks it down:  
@NYGovCuomo could you explain just what is your job as Govenor ? You seem to want someone else to be responsible 4 everything If I remember right, in my life time we've had to bail you ( NY ) out twice  …
No one will admit it, but today @NYGovCuomo grabbed @realDonaldTrump by the balls and squeeze them pretty hard. Enough, that our President threaten three states with Democratic governors. I like @NYGovCuomo everyday.
I listen to my governor @NYGovCuomo 
Hospitals and state health departments say they've been scouring the globe to find swabs and lab chemicals used for coronavirus  against each other in a system New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described as “mayhem." 
Cuomo has done more for us (NY) during Covid 19 than Trump has done for anyone his entire life
Say what you will, but Cuomo is VERY good at this.  …
thank you for taking charge during this pandemic @NYGovCuomo. Doing more than our “ president “  …
THEY GAVE SHAKE SHACK MONEY? IT IS A MULTINATIONAL CONGLOMERATION, @NYGovCuomo. No word for Brooklyn's oldest bookstore who applied on time. What gives?
Play the video of Cuomo screaming for the 30,000 ventilators that he never needed. Where's THAT video?
Brilliant!
RT @realDonaldTrump Uncle Murdock here with a few thoughts about @BilldeBlasio and his “bailout” for New York City. Maybe include @NYGovCuomo in this discussion, have them both to the White House on camera and break the audit news to them! 
@NYGovCuomo The WH miscreant is working hard. It takes time and energy to lie, “pass the buck to Governors” and incite rioting of his base in specific states. This poor excuse for a potus and his enablers will be pilloried by historians forever.
Where is this action from @NYGovCuomo? New York needs to follow Washington's lead and stop all water shutoffs in New York state/restore service universally/waive late fees.  …
Florida did absolutely nothing to mitigate the spread of #COVID19 in the beginning & very little in recent weeks they will be 100 time worse than New York its everywhere in Florida & the Governor keeps lying about the numbers, when covid19 reaches its peak,Florida is in trouble..
When will @NYGovCuomo catch up?  …

I believe George Romney would be profoundly disappointed in her for blind allegiance to a person that is the antithesis of Republican ideals. Trump is no Republican and she should be ashamed of her conduct.
Just make @NYGovCuomo or @GovLarryHogan President. Whoever loses is VP
Cuomo will blame DeBlasio and vice versa...Both of them are  idiots
This clip will go down in history. @NYGovCuomo is all of us.  …
Trump is no match for @NYGovCuomo Thank you Gov. Cuomo  …
I've lost my pride in being an American under the current leader, but my pride in being a New Yorker has never been higher. Thanks @NYGovCuomo for saying what most are thinking but don't dare say.  …
This is the kind of things I want my Governor @GovWhitmer to say during her pressers. Do you know why that will never happen? Because she's a woman & she would get eaten alive if she talked like this. IT TICKS ME OFF ! This is what needs to be said in MI !
it's been a good day i am thankful for @NYGovCuomo @maddow @NicolleDWallace @K_JeanPierre @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @ourladyj & all the incredible doctors, nurses, health care workers risking everything on the front lines all over the nation. it was a creative day kids stay safe
Cuomo waited too long to close businesses, bars, restaurants and schools. Then, he went on a fear mongering month long rant telling NYers they were going to choke to death because he needed ventilators.
Not to mention the useless HOURS he spends on twitter. Myself, being self-employed but still a nobody, put limits on twitter/internet/social media time cause there's too much else to do. Incredible to see Trump tweeting on Saturday nights, Sundays & every workday!
It is clear the president is over running this country, especially during a pandemic Every single person needs to listen to this clip Thank you @NYGovCuomo for being transparent & thank you for your hardwork We need legislators that have actually done work in their lives  …
When this is over, I wish another Italian-American Al Pacino plays Andrew Cuomo in a movie about NY's response to Corona. What a guy! 
Andrew Coumo claps back. Well done @NYGovCuomo Well done  …
and @FoxNews stop televising the daily @NYGovCuomo WHINING SESSION! Or find another planet to broadcast on
I want test kits @NYGovCuomo Enough is enough. #RensselaerCounty got 100. Pathetic and unacceptable.
Gov. CUOMO! Can you not govern your own state? The people of NY voted you to do just that! Stop whining and demanding that everyone else do things for you. Get up and start doing it yourself. You didnt want the Pres. telling you what to do. So STOP your daily bitch session!
Spoke to a NY State Assemblyman today and he confirmed that while on a conference call with Cuomo this morning (April 17th) @NYGovCuomo said golf courses are allowed to open in New York woth safety modifications, privately owned and municipal courses #golf #nygolf #golfchannel
You still trust him even though he was hoarding ventilators while claiming people were dying without them? WTH?
SSSOOOOOOO behind Gov Andrew Cuomo! whatever you need sir, if I can help, I will. you are speaking for the PEOPLE when you speak! We got you and you got us, we get that! : )
Really? You think he’s gotten it right the whole time? Remember  …
Thank you to a PEF Workers you have cared for NYS well @NYSPEF @NYGovCuomo @WayneSpence99 @AFT_PE @Dakotacyr @rweingarten 
U mean the same Andrew Cuomo who put a out of business solar  ahead of buying ventilators? Same guy who didnt have our hospitals ready for a pandemic so the feds had 2 bail him out. Same Andy who has run up a 700 billion dollar debt and seeing NYers flee out of here
He acts like he has nothing, lied about the holding, bugged @realDonaldTrump to death for more. @NYGovCuomo is selfish and cares only about himself. If he cared about others, he would have distributed what he had and no one would have run short. #Idiot #CuomoMeltdown
NY'er here - all cuomo does is grandstand. He finds the nearest camera and just whines - never bothers to thank FEMA or the Army Core of Engineers for the AMAZING work they did for NY - nope - he's a total loser and an ingrate to boot!
Good thing Trump doesn't use briefings to vent, Hannity would have a conniption, I guess...
Hannity on @NYGovCuomo : “If he keeps using these press sessions as public venting sessions...why couldn’t he just say that he’s working with the federal government to get more testing?” Because @realDonaldTrump won’t ramp up #COVID19 testing. 
Funny, few realize that the numbers are being suppressed and depressed in most other states. We get daily updates from New Jersey & @NYGovCuomo but what about accurate death toll numbers from other states? Crickets. Feds aren't reporting the numbers. Numbers are way higher.
I hate getting in the middle of politics but damn if Cuomo did not just shoot himself up to number 1 option for 2024 with that speech. Yikes. He buried Trump 18 feet under, not 6.
This is what @NYGovCuomo @NYSDOLCommish @melissadderosa are doing to people. Try harder. Go faster. You all aren’t taking this seriously enough!!!  …
Ya know who's all about TV, ratings and politics over lives? @NYGovCuomo GOOD GRAVY You remind me of a hoodrat dressed up at the last min by ur lawyer to look presentable for court, TRYING to sound smart! You and your saggy titty rings just shish!!! 
Any insight to provide as to where first responders (and their families) can schedule the antibody tests that were rolled out this week for the frontline? Missing our #FDNY firefighter at home @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @nytimes @FDNY @UFANYC
You mean like in early March when King Cuomo said the risk was low or when King Cuomo said we are prepared?
Cuomo has been governor of NY since 2011. He's had ample time to provide leadership for his state. Since the Chinese virus pandemic, he's been on FOX every day begging POTUS to cover for his 9 years of failed preparation.  to liberalism; no accountability 
. @realDonaldTrump is demanding "less talk and more action" from @NYGovCuomo. Cuomo said the government provided "zero, zilch, nada in unrestricted aid," during a Friday press conference. 
Did @NYGovCuomo accuse #POTUS of being lazy? Whoa - this President is tireless, everyone sees it and dude you just made an ass of yourself... 
WATCH: New York Gov. Cuomo responds to the president's plan to reopen the country: “I don’t need the president of the United States to read the Constitution for me.” 
Hannity on Cuomo: If he keeps using these press sessions as public venting sessions... 
So true… And seriously, has anyone ever seen a more miserable, vainglorious garbage excuse of a person— let alone President of the United States— than the worthless, bloated, orange, treason moron Trump.
Exactly, isn’t it ironic how she dropped Romney in her name just to please trump. Just goes to show how much loyalty she has to family. @GovWhitmer is doing a great job for the people she represents. I watch her and @NYGovCuomo news briefings for up to dates on coronavirus.
Just an 
Actually there isn't still time. And time wasn't what was needed, Brains my friend Brains were needed.
Tammy Duckworth is lying. Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said no one — NO ONE — died because they didn’t have a ventilator. It’s a pretty sick thing to lie like this!  …
That really breaks my heart to read that!! I thank god every day @NYGovCuomo is my governor!! 
I just ran a 5K on my treadmill. I’m hydrating right now. I’m not going to lie this has been a hard week. I’ve only gone to the supermarket and bank and I was afraid going. I’m wearing a mask and have more on order. Thank god @NYGovCuomo is my governor!
@MarkRuffalo, respectfully, no. Cuomo passed an austerity budget in the midst of the crisis that will squeeze hospitals and refuses to act on the crushing rent bills that  to unemployed workers. Sure, he's not Trump, but we need better than him in NYS.
Y’all, REMEMBER THE MTA IS NEAR BANKRUPT AND STILL HIRING MORE COPS PER CUOMO as people struggle to eat and say goodbye to loved ones, and Wall Street gets the biggest bailout in history. On May 1, we respond, fuck the police, rent strike, and more #ftp #cancelrent #rentstrike 
That ship has sailed.
Dear @realDonaldTrump, There is still time for you to  a great leader. You should watch & learn from @NYGovCuomo. He reads the White House reports on #Covid_19 and acts on that info. You could start there. 
Cuomo blew money all over the place on his pet projects, none of which helped NY taxpayers. @NYGovCuomo responsible for lack of preparation, no one else #coronavirus
@NYGovCuomo took the buffoon to school today.

RE-OPEN MD
So you’re calling @NYGovCuomo a liar? He explicitly stated no citizen of NY died due to lack of ventilators.  …
He also had a delayed response that has led to the extremely high number of cases. Sure NY is pretty densely populated, but Newsom acted way faster and CA (also pretty dense in regions) has had a fraction of cases. Fuck Cuomo. People only like that he has publicly argued w Trump.
If you spent eternity, going through every word tRUmp has uttered since the fateful escelator ride, you couldn't piece together 9 minutes this spectacular.
He sits around doing his interviews 4 the cameras, raging on the federal government for not “giving” him everything he wants instead of being a damned leader and getting things for his state himself. He wasn’t ready for this, hence, he wants others to furnish him with everything
Gov Cuomo, you are brilliant. I can watch this tape all night long......your Dad is on his feet giving you a standing ovation! Congrats and God bless....
I have watched this more times than I should admit. It’s mesmerizing.

45 clearly doesn’t understand “better safe than sorry”. I’m sorry that Gov. Cuomo has to put up with 45’s pettiness and lack of humanity. Gov. Cuomo is a thousand times the man 45 aspires to be.
cuomo just called “death” and “getting back to work” the “yin and the yang”

I think the doctors and nurses would argu that point with you as the ERs and hospitals are still overwhelmed have little to no supplies and need refrigeration trucks for their dead

US President @realDonaldTrump and New York Governor @NYGovCuomo have resumed their war of words, over federal funding. Mr Cuomo lashed out at the President as the state struggles to contain coronavirus.

Cuomo said he needed 30,000 ventilators. Dr. Fauci agreed on 3/29. Trump thought that was too many, but he sent them, and do you know how many vents Cuomo ultimately needed? Just 5,000! Did you see any news stories "Trump was right, Fauci and Cuomo wrong"?  …
This is at least 75% on the media which absolutely INSISTS on grading media presentation rather than substance.
It still guts me that people think @NYGovCuomo is worthy of praise. He cut Medicaid. During a pandemic. He passed a harsh bail law to jail more Black & Brown people. During a pandemic. He lied that he has no power to release people & refuses to save lives. During a pandemic.

‘Our only mistake was believing your numbers and your projections’: Governor Andrew Cuomo on President  suggesting New York had asked for too much aid that was never fully used  
I don't trust this guy as far as I could throw him. He was then when Trump said, Testing? There's no problem with testing. He was there when Trump wet his pants and was saying testing is no problem. We have lots of tests. Get them all off the stage. Let @NYGovCuomo carryon.
@NYGovCuomo you’re a clown Cuomo and no CYA will cover the fact that you were not prepared for any disaster and that you encouraged people to attend Chinese Lunar Festivals in mid-Feb! You have on your hands!

I'm Canadian but listening to Cuomo, he's definitely the one that should be President of America!!!
Hi, Yes this is ( @MinnieBellW/ @Willis_Hubbard_ ) Have you heard about these large group of people with no protection on their faces, marching to homes of governors? They want to get back to work, sooner than advised? Well I retweeted this 1 from> 
Can we keep the @NYGovCuomo pressers going on the regular, even when this is over?
The store may well have taken action. I wasn't staying there to confront them. Everybody's jumping to conclusions here. I know the people who own the store. They're good people. I wasn't the only 1 who witnessed their idiocy & I'm sure I wasn't the only 1 who reported them.
Cuomo thinks the 10th Amendment to the Constitution gives him the power to do whatever he wants. Wrong. He really should read Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, known as the Commerce Clause. Congress has the authority to make him reopen NY's economy. He doesn't get the last word.
Cuomo and Trump spar after NY governor says don’t 'pass the buck without passing the bucks'  … Cuomo.. A dirty, hypocrite, backstabbing SNAKEhe doesn’t know the meaning of Humility, gratefulness and appreciation..Now he turns around and criticized POTUS?
I do the same thing. (tho, I'm not a Georgia girl)
Thanks Cuomo, I'm in Texas & wished everyone would stand up, to Don the Con.
I hope they can be arrested, then put in a cell all together with no masks or disinfectant.
Let me clarify - I was in the parking lot loading up my car. I was not inside the store. I stopped at sheriff's substation on my way home. No one there. The best I could do is call down to substation.
Cuomo is a playing the victim card. @NYGovCuomo Cuomo, man-up and take responsibility!
National Guard should arrest them. Put the fools in the same jail cell. They don't mind spreading it or getting sick so let them. Just keep them away from normal people who would prefer to live and respect others.

That's not picking. Already been through that 2 weeks ago. Couple of locals were harassing clerks at local store. Wanted to return recyclables, but store wasn't accepting them. When they got loud I called Sheriff. Took a few calls & 20 mins. to get help. Today was scarier.
hey @twitter did you hear about the #trumpers who invaded a grocery store screaming and yelling that they were going to infect people as they cursed out @NYGovCuomo Do you understand this violence was incited by #trump #tweets? When will you act responsibly?
@NYGovCuomo did like always... Facts, nothing but facts! Sometimes you gotta smack a bully! #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath #GOPGenocide #BidenHarris2020 #ByeDon2020
Come off your high horse. He's more supportive of Republican-governed states than Democratic-governed states. Name one Red state he has bad mouthed.
Does anyone REALLY think that to the states he mentioned, the GAVE ventilators? How much did he charge them? A pretty penny, I will bet. @NYGovCuomo has failed his constituents 110%. They deserve better than this failure. @POTUS
Cuomo is  He has no clue how to put a plan together for his state. Horrible management. He was never qualified to be a Governor. He really does need to get off his butt and bring people together to form a plan. Then ask for money, not prior.
You, sir, better run for president one day. THIS is incredible! BRAVO!!!!!
Jesus... they should be arrested.

If one of those fools gets in my 6 foot personal space, I'm gonna close that gap quick and they're gonna be picking themselves up wondering wtf just happened. I'm not even playing with ignorant folk right now.
Cuomo is mad! I don’t blame him. We can all see (except Trumpets) that Trump is setting the governors up to take the fall for his  The states do not have the money or the capacity to get all the test kits & supplies.
It’s fascinating to watch the difference in the briefings that @NYGovCuomo gives and @realDonaldTrump gives. Cuomo is all facts. Trump is also kissing his own ass, and lying.
They plan to shoot the virus with their guns.
Rural areas are susceptible to a prepper mentality. Primarily Trump fans. It's the same in northern Michigan, Idaho, western Montana, etc. Lots of militia groups on SSDI or SS that like to play soldier. Really. Have many relatives in those double-wide trailer shot-gun house areas
Shameful The Governor's want control but lack the ability to LEAD. Watching @NYGovCuomo daily whining showing the inability to organize his own State & blaming his ineptitude on the Federal Govt imagine he fancies himself a leader sure ok
NYC is a mess bc of your LOUSY policies & lack of leadership: sky high taxes, criminals let go w no bail, people leaving in droves. You didn’t stock medical necessities! You pandered to GND instead! Now you want to use Covid as your personal piggy bank/unlimited bailout? #LOSER
This wasn't a "rally", per se. Just a bunch of guys who were mouthing off. No real organization. They got themselves all riled up and decided to start intimidating people. That's how it starts, though...then someone gets hurt. Whole new reason to stay home.
Stay safe. And as always “DON’T FEED the TROLLS” confronting them is oxygen. They need video of confrontation. Don’t give it to them. Ignoring, walking away, and not taking photos makes them into lame gamers.
Trump falsely suggests that the Javits Center field hospital was not needed. Cuomo said today that it treated 800 patients, below a capacity designed for CDC projections. Meanwhile, DOD contracts for other field hospitals getting little scrutiny.  …
Cuomo is so much more presidential than Trump!
We’ve heard @NYGovCuomo bitch & moan about not enuf ventilators when he was hoarding thousands. Now he’s bitching about testing. THE LAW: IT IS YOUR GOVERNOR’S JOB TO HAVE ENUF FOR YOUR STATE A lot of governors’ mismanaged your state’s funds are the issue-NOT @POTUS MY STATE 
It was apparently a national effort today. I'm hearing reports of these virus rallies from several states, including Huntington Beach, CA. It's about 200 days until the election. I worry that there's so much more damage they can do.
My first question to trump would be, have you found your left nut that Andrew Cuomo crushed like a mini walnut this morning?
This man. Articulate, focused, assertive, confident. He’s a *teacher.* A leader’s leader.
This guy should be President
I don't either. I feel gutless for not confronting them, but honest to God, it was scary. Trump is exploiting this whole "us" vs. "them" thing and damn it, it's working. His lies are working. I don't understand how or why, but it's happening.
It’s Fredos fathers bridge 
I don’t know what to say...
So @NYGovCuomo you scream now for Fed help with BUCKS!! You bankrupted your own state? Answer us this you loud mouth liar!

This should be a democratic ad.
Go to hell @NYGovCuomo! We're sick of your daily groveling! @POTUS has prioritized you & New Yorkers from day ONE you MISERABLE INGRATE! With the obscene rent for closets called apartments & outrageous taxes in NY you should have enough money! Thank ILLEGALS for your BROKE State!
RT Every State Governor and every City Mayor should do the opposite of what @NYGovCuomo & @BilldeBlasio do for New York. That way their states will actually survive and not have to beg from DC. Inventory your stockpiles and be aware & prepared for everything unlike New York!

“The federal government cannot wipe their hands of this and say, 'Oh, the states are responsible for testing'...We cannot do it without federal help...This is mayhem.” @NYGovCuomo wants to suck the fed tit forever. Don’t let him @realDonaldTrump!! 
He got lit up by @NYGovCuomo. Torched.
Our Governor isn’t whining about how Pres @realDonaldTrump & Fed govt owes AZ more - @dougducey is thinking outside the box & partnering w/ @uarizona to increase testing & reopen AZ. Stop whining, @NYGovCuomo - less talk, more action for the people of NY!  …
When I listen to @NYGovCuomo speak, I can feel my neck, chest & ab muscles relax. I very much appreciate his daily press conference
As chairman of the @NatlGovsAssoc, today I joined my vice chair @NYGovCuomo in renewing our bipartisan request for fiscal relief for the states. Our full statement: 
Exactly this guy was Expecting his hand to be held ... Then to make  That the President is just sitting at home watching Tv is Idiotic ....He lives in the White House and is on call 24/7 .... Cuomo is a Typical Dem tons of ideas For everyone to do but himself
He did not ‘ mock’ Trump, he answered him politely and in a very measured way !!! Stop with the ‘ mocks’ line ! @NYGovCuomo is too busy doing his job and doing it so so well! From Ireland , I’m grateful my extended family’s lives are in his hands
Governor Cuomo calmly, but firmly put the president in his place. Too many people just let everything tRump says and does go. There’s no correction. There’s no push back. I’m proud of @NYGovCuomo for standing up for himself, for the people of NY and for all Americans.
@NYGovCuomo has done his state an absolute fantastic job ! He’s lead them all the way and tried his best good health to NY from Scotland
Democrats should make clear, as Cuomo did today, that it was the Trump administration that told us 2m Americans could die from this virus. People are being quarantined based on the information Trump gave us. If they have a problem with it, take it up with the man they voted for.
Leave @NYGovCuomo alone! He’s busy saving lives! Thank you @NYGovCuomo we appreciate you! #CuomoIsTheActingPresident

Hey @NYGovCuomo : do you need @realDonaldTrump  up there and hold your hand while he does everything??? All you do is bitch about the federal government not doing enough for you!! Get your ass off TV and handle your own fucking business!!!!
I’m a Georgia girl who listens to everything @NYGovCuomo says and turns off the tv whenever  on.
Old rubber face Cuomo is a wannabe tough guy and he needs to be a man and stand on his own two feet. President Trump can’t hold his hand forever. #WhinningCryingCuomo
The best 9 minutes of Cuomo yet!
I would love to see a debate between @NYGovCuomo and @realDonaldTrump. Pay per view. Watch Gov. Cuomo tear him apart.
My favorite line from Cuomo’s briefing, “ he’s watching TV? Maybe he should get up and go to work.” and then, “he wants me to say thank you? Fine. Thank you for taking a modicum of responsibility for doing your job”.
I love my Governor! @NYGovCuomo Yes, watch all the way to the end!  …

Cuomo the Clown has been 100% wrong on every one of his fear mongering dire predictions so now NYC is just counting any death as a corvid victim to prop up his bullshit and then he has the nerve to blame Trump for his total over reaction
Elected officials, labor  groups demand immediate action to support immigrants.  by @NYGovCuomo saying “it would be irresponsible” to support undocumented immigrants, groups call for a fund to meet basic needs of all NYers. Mon. April 21, 1pm 
Trump bent over backwards to give Cuomo everything he screamed he needed. And he didn't need it but it cost the taxpayer millions. Now Cuomo is using his soapbox for more money and to tell us what a lousy dad he's been for years. Time for him to be quiet.

Cuomo is one of the most inept governors in the country and we've had our share. He got too cute with Trump. So @potus leg-swiped him and made him look stupid. @NYGovCuomo is now just another ungrateful democrat cry baby. Against Trump, they're 0-387. Losers.

I so agree. And Cuomo was initially, so patient.

I agree he has shown  compassion and character than the President. His conferences are uplifting even in the face of despair.
@realDonaldTrump dislikes NYS because he's being sued by NYS AG. That's why he moved to FL. @realDonaldTrump wants to hide and NYS to hold him, his family & his Companies accountable. That's why @realDonaldTrump tries to blame any leader like @NYGovCuomo & every 1 else.

NY has less people than Florida but 3 times the budget and they still can’t get it done. Oh yeah Florida doesn’t have a state tax. Cuomo is a fraud and is exposed for it

When trump attacks Andrew Cuomo, we all need to stand up. Not because you like everything about Cuomo, but because you detest everything about trump and he is insulting a man who has worked tirelessly for his state and it's citizens. The laziest man in history attacking Cuomo?

This is WHY I care a lot for my governor! @NYGovCuomo knows how to handle a crisis and handle Trump!  …
It's not even a political opponent! So far, @NYGovCuomo isn't running for president, although he'd beat @realDonaldTrump without even needing to campaign. It's just that Cuomo has the respect of his constituents. tRump is so jealous of that kind of power. #ToddlerinChief
@NYGovCuomo dragged Trump 
@NYGovCuomo has stayed away from the political cat and mouse games that Trump likes to play, until Trump's recent tweets. Enough is enough, even so, Cuomo just stated facts without acting like a petty child.
AJ you couldn’t be more wrong I LIVE HERE
