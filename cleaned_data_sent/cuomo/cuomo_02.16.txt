Cigarettes in a different wrapper? Why are you not banning cigarettes then?
As long as you allow sale  cigarettes it is immoral to deny adult smokers access to safer products. E-cigs are twice as effective as other nicotine replacement products (gum/patch) at helping smokers quit. Enforce T-21 & protect kids thru discipline & parenting.

Hate to break it to you, but flavors aren't going anywhere. There are ~10 million American adults who vape flavored nicotine e-liquids, and millions more who smoke menthol cigarettes. Your so-called "ban" is just going to drive everything underground to the illicit market.
3 lies in 1 tweet, really impressive. 1. It seems you are not protecting your kids since they still seem to do illegal stuff without getting punished 2. Flavours don't hook kids, curiousity does 3. Taking safer alternatives away from addults is only right if you are Big T.

Say what u want about @BernieSanders but he has been consistent about his philosophy from day 1 & never played the expedient game. Unlike @BilldeBlasio who was a water boy 4 @NYGovCuomo, a Clinton flunky, & actually endorsed Hillary over Bernie in 2016. It’s all about Bill
@NYGovCuomo Sir: it’s the left, dems in Congress, the UN (time to kick them out) that are pushing an anti Semitic agenda! Those acts you see are fostered by the anti-semitic environment tolerated by dems in congress, the UN!  …

New York is supposed to be a sanctuary city. Yet NYPD cooperates with ICE and Eric was SHOT by an ICE officer. This week, call your state reps, the mayor & @NYGovCuomo to tell them they must act to  from ICE. #AbolishICE
Spicy “Media Project” as @AlanChartock explains how “flattered” he is that @NYGovCuomo chooses him as an interlocutor (instead of doing Capitol press conferences); @rexwsmith suggests that’s maybe not a sound journalistic response. Starts at  …
Tell @NYGovCuomo: No Williams pipeline. No National Grid North Brooklyn fracked gas pipeline. No LNG bomb trucks.  
Andrew Cuomo @NYGovCuomo Someone Wants To Thank You: Charles Barry, 56 “Bail reform, it’s lit!” He served stints in state prison & a lengthy record, 6 felonies, 87 misdemeanors and 21 missed court hearings. He's been arrested 6 times since January 1,2020

For every death caused by an illeagal in ‘Sanctuary Cities’, those politicians should be charged with Facilitation, arrested, prosecuted, and sent to prison!

Governor your Green Light Law Sancuary City is an abuse of Power. Illegal Immigrants need to be held accountable. Your action is extorting American Freedoms! #StopSancuaryCities 
Governor you claim no one is above the Law, especially when speaking about @realDonaldTrump .. However your sanctuary City Policy and Laws have made illegal immigrants  violent crimes above the law.  …
That's government. Don't act like you, of all people, don't know this.
Your system is perhaps broken if a driver accumulates 232 tickets over 4+ years, has apparently NEVER registered his car, and hasn't paid a single penny of $8,000+ in total fines – yet said driver and vehicle are still on the road. cc: @NYCSpeakerCoJo @NYGovCuomo  …

I quit smoking by vaping almost 8 years ago and I'm healthier now than I have been since I started smoking as a teen. My smoker's cough is gone, my endurance is great, and I no longer get colds and respiratory infections. My doctor couldn't tell I had ever been a smoker.
Why not? That is your M.O. It's what you are best known for. What's the matter, @realDonaldTrump is beating you at your own game? #hypocrite #takebackNY #TeamParentsNY 
Obviously, the @NYGovCuomo just publicly stated he's suffering from a case of #dissociative mental #disorder, as he condemns the same kind of political behaviour in which he continuosly acts himself! #NotMentallyFitForOffice #Hubris

It was an honor to stand shoulder to shoulder with  today to say no to National Grid’s pipeline. We refuse to pay for Grid’s fracked gas pipeline and if @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo won’t stop it,  will.  …
I agree with you Gov Cuomo. Don't 2nd guess yourself. Trump is using extortion, just as he did with the Ukraine! I also love in a sanctuary city. We have had a decrease in crime except for the illegal use of guns. And those crimes were from citizens...
Almost everything you do is an abuse of power. If you left the Green Light Laws and Bail Reform up to the voters, neither one would have passed.
Ex smokers around the world face-palming at this tweet.
As always, love our totally acceptable @NYCTBus headways and @NYGovCuomo’s @MTA route reshuffle adds $0 to improve
