The funny part is your administration just let the leaders of a $7 million ring go without bail in NYC. Can't keep the pandering and reality of your crappy legislation straight. I mean, if you're going to pander at least don't turn around and contradict it.
Amen brother. I’m a LIFE LONG Democrat and from this point on I’m voting Republican and so is my wife. Do I want a fare beater to sit in jail if he can’t afford bail? Of course not. But these idiots have gone WAY BEYOND  sense and reason!
