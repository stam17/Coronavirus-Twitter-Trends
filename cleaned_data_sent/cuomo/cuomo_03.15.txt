She’s taken care of, but that’s an exceptionally kind offer
That seems shortsighted as it's a close contact - inside of a car could be contaminated by either the driver or mechanic - who could go on to spread it. Moreover, the mechanic may not be able to get parts to do any required repairs with the supply chain as it is.
She need anyone to bring her groceries?

There are more targeted ways, but they rely on a robust and widespread testing infrastructure that we simply don't have yet. Your only option before that's available is social distancing measures. After you can test everyone you need to you can do case islotation and such.

I think the most over looked group in the hospital is the environmental services staff. They do an amazing job keeping everything clean and germs at bay. I'm an RN and couldn't do anything without these wonderful people.
Shame on you, @BilldeBlasio. Hopefully @NYGovCuomo can intervene.  …
Cheers, @NYGovCuomo - thanks for your leadership during these chaotic times! 
That is the status quo for responses, but given the #CoronavirusPandemic + the potential for it to wreak havoc in the city's jails + state prisons, these institutions (cc: @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo) should be doing more to keep the public informed.
My dad was a janitor in a school & cleaned up after messy little jerks every day. He had an incredible work ethic. I don’t remember him missing a shift. Tomorrow is 4 years since we lost him. So thank you for singling out janitors...on the front lines in hospitals and elsewhere.
Nurses, I had to genuinely thank a nurse for trying so hard to answer my questions as accurately as possible. Heartfelt thanks to all the first responders and to everyone we can rely on during this trying time
At @NYGovCuomo's direction, all DMV offices statewide are closed until further notice. While offices are closed, expiration dates for driver licenses, non-driver IDs, and registrations will be extended. And all road tests will be suspended until further notice.

In addition to seeking to roll back bail reform, @NYGovCuomo has by executive order suspended procedural time limits that normally require people to be released after one week in jail if their case is not indicted. TL;DR: They’re using the pandemic to keep more people in jail.  …

I just checked in with two friends in Kentucky who said they had watched a @NYGovCuomo Coronavirus briefing this week. (They also said @AndyBeshearKY was handling the crisis well.)
But even officials like @NYGovCuomo and @GavinNewsom who have done such exemplary work daily are holding the true solution as a last  enforced lock down of their citizens--because we want to allow people shades of the freedoms they hold so dear. 6/
Insane! #BeBest #Floriduh Can @NYGovCuomo please be in charge !!!
Immigrants. We get the job done #StrongerTogether
The lack of and questionable leadership at the top certainly is allowing governors to shine -- @NYGovCuomo and @AndyBeshearKY
For the president to not invoke the DPA minute by minute we lose ground and more lives. I can't think of worse inaction at this moment in time in the US. Good thing @GovWhitmer and @NYGovCuomo are leading (among others) in our respective states.  …
One of the things a few New York voters I talked to stressed: New York has some of the most restrictive primary voting laws in the nation, & @NYGovCuomo needs to act now to implement measures, like universal vote-by-mail, to ensure everyone can vote during the COVID-19 crisis.

. @NYGovCuomo asked retired #NYC HC workers  and help with the #Coronavirus. Over 1000 doctors & nurses came out in 1 day to join Medical Reserve. That's humanity!
Please send more tests to Erie County. We have people not being tested. I know there is a federal delay. But please. As a nurse I am begging. Please send us more tests to stop this spread.
We strive for no new cases, if possible; however, @NYGovCuomo this is the best of a bad situation. That means our case-mix skews younger (like SK and Germany) which means a significantly higher recovery rate and low fatality rate.  
NY has the most cases because it is testing way more than anyone else. This is 8th grade stuff.

Is this person Elena really asking if Cuomo is so great why does NY have so many cases of Covid19?
Would it hurt Trump, to be human for once, Americans are reaching out to him for Leadership?
Who ELSE wishes @NYGovCuomo & @GavinNewsom were in charge of the National COVID-19 Response Team?? I DO
And a point about the relation of policy to data: NY accounts for fully half of confirmed cases of #COVID19, despite @NYGovCuomo leading one of the most aggressive state-based responses. @GovBillLee needs to understand that thoughts and prayers will be ineffective as policy.
Your briefings are an  of information, what to expect, problem solving, and emphasis  Kudos for your leadership!

New Yorkers have the cajones to stare down difficult problems & tackle them head-on, even while telling hard to hear truths about the challenges that lie ahead & the sacrifices that are required. That's what @NYGovCuomo is doing in response to #CoronavirusPandemic #leadership

@NYGovCuomo I work in one of the top hospitals in NY and I have several coworkers who have been possibly exposed to COVID-19. Our job is telling us that those who are symptomatic won’t be tested 1/
Thanks to @NYGovCuomo for clear, factual  leadership during these difficult times. His press conferences have  a must see for timely, informative & hopeful content.  …
@TrueFactsStated @NYGovCuomo said that an $0.80 mask is costing him $4.00. Are you still able to get them for $0.80? If so, maybe get in touch with him asap so they can change their order.
When @NYGovCuomo leaves office, I hope he heads right over to the @JoeBiden administration. Cuomo has been strikingly brilliant and strong fighting for all New Yorkers & standing up to Trump.
Have been so impressed w @NYGovCuomo in this crisis; leadership has been phenomenal  …
How about converting the empty Derby New Era cap factory into a Covid-19 mask & gown producer? @TheBuffaloNews @buffalopundit @news4buffalo @NYGovCuomo
I'm a highly trained RN & a health activist. Right now I'm focusing on health activism cause there are fewer of us & w/ @NYGovCuomo's proposed austerity budget- it's the bigger need. #NoMedicaidCuts Non-clinicians, make that not-be-true. Learn  …
Add @CSiriano with @NYGovCuomo and the drive to help out during a pandemic, and you get results. #OneNewYork  …
Went outside for some brief air without the dog. 1. So many people are outside in Astoria Queens. 2. They do not practice social distancing. At all. I was the only person moving to achieve 6 feet. #wtf @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor
Putting more people in jail during #COVID19 will harm lives at a time when we need to be saving them. Call @NYGovCuomo to say #NoRollbacks to 
I would much rather watch @NYGovCuomo give detailed, truthful and dignified briefings about CoVid-19, than have to endure the gameshow antics of @realDonaldTrump trying to gaslight an entire nation just to make himself look 
Folks working in our food production facilities enabling store shelves to stay stocked- like the amazing crew @DSM Schenectady @NYGovCuomo  …
Love it! That’s awesome! Yes, Michigan is DOTTED with places that could mobilize for production for many things. Much as the Motor City mobilized for WWII.
“This is humanity in stereo and on steroids.” — @NYGovCuomo The healthcare workers, pharmacists, police & fire, grocery workers, caretakers, etc. — these are our heroes. #Covid_19 #StayAtHome #COVIDー19 #PresidentCuomo #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic 
I find it very reassuring to listen to @realDonaldTrump and @NYGovCuomo brief us daily. Would we rather just be in the dark?
As long as @GregAbbott_TX or his good old Republican boys don't have the virus, he won't do a damn thing for the People of Texas. You can see who the weakest Governor's are now. Abbott is a coward.
Best thing about the ‘Trump is getting ready to fire Dr. Fauci,’ subplot is when Trump finally does fire Dr. Fauci, @NYGovCuomo can immediately hire him as lead immunologist for NY State and the media can then forever ignore @realDonaldTrump’s disinformation ‘press conferences.’
I want to thank @NYGovCuomo  leadership right now.
Garbage truck drivers!
Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom are our new presidents.
I’m a New Yorker and more I live in Manhattan the epicenter of COVID-19. We are not panicking because @NYGovCuomo is our governor. He is absolute calm and control in a bottle. (Our Bernie supporting Mayor is choking, to put it politely, but Cuomo has the power)
@NYCMayor @AOC @NYGovCuomo Please convert some #NYC park space to large  food gardens- it is an achievable, social distancing friendly goal with a tangible benefits, that we can do right now to address food security & cultivate civic engagement.
New York is declared a disaster area yet I'l be going to work on Monday to build luxury apartments in Brooklyn because it's "essential"! Thanks . @NYGovCuomo #StopConstruction #CoronavirusNewYork  …
Contrast between Trump and @NYGovCuomo could not be more stark. Gov. Cuomo   leader. Trump is ongoing danger to the nation and so is the fawning, Stepford-like VP Pence.  …

I have appreciated @NYGovCuomo daily press briefings. If more governors are doing them, I wish we would see them broadcast more so that we better understand the crisis on a local level. I appreciate the WH press briefings, too.  …
All they are doing is gaslighting us, and lying to us. The networks should not even cover it. It make me livid already at how they downplayed this, all for Trump’s political interest, damn American lives that will be lost. Sickening!
#Janitors. Don’t forget these unsung heroes who clean up unbelievable messes everyday - many while exposed to #toxins.
@RepMaloney @NYGovCuomo @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand my sister is stuck in Peru. She and many other New York constituents need your help. @StateDept has been unhelpful in providing information or logistical support. They can't  flights out #stuckinPeru #stuckincusco

No, @NYGovCuomo, cutting Medicaid is not a "technical problem." It's a morally bankrupt idea. We don't need cuts to Medicaid in the face of a pandemic. #COVID19 #NoMedicaidCuts  …
It sucks to say it but @NYGovCuomo needs to close parks. People out there playing 5 on 5 basketball, parents with kids using the playground sets for some reason? Folks playing touch football. C'mon people
dudes, not even sorry saying this- @NYGovCuomo is handling the HELL out of this #covidcrisis here in NYC. glad to be able to listen to the calm and cool voice of an actual leader for a change, who'da thunk. #LikeABoss
He's a Cuomo his father wss a good Gov he learned from the best
Every day in New York we see back-to-back press conferences like CUOMO: Be strong. Don’t be stupid. Listen to the experts. TRUMP: Foot Locker….Auntie Anne’s Pretzels…GameStop has been terrific, with the video games
Submitted.   …
Luckily Cuomo is aired nationally and provides the most up to date information available. And so sorry about that.
This is what has replaced his rallies. Press should send one pool reporter and NEVER cover live.
Thank you Javier! You are amazing! We are emailing you now to follow up on this.
This #data should make you furious at @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo for not closing down NY a week ago, and for pending shutdown to still be >36hrs away.  …

Maybe running a campaign not best use of his time - he seems kinda busy just now.
Where are the tests! Trump said they would be available in my local Walmart parking lot. They are not. It was a lie. Our family members are sick. We need tests now in Texas!
@GregAbbott_TX does not know the meaning of Leadership
I'm a fan of neither, at all, but I find the contrast between Gov. Cuomo and Mayor Groundhog Murderer to be remarkable. @NYCMayor underperforms already incredibly low expectations routinely. @NYGovCuomo has been as solid as anyone, surpassing my expectations.  …

Happy to help, @nygovcuomo. We’re all in this together. 
If only our leaders were more like you and our @GavinNewsom. Getting shit done. #LFG
 @NYGovCuomo for his leadership, the type of leadership we need right now. #GovernorCuomo: Thank you for your tough mind and tender heart during this crisis. You should consider running for POTUS in the future.
Listen to @NYGovCuomo for the truth. Turn this nonense off.
YES @NYGovCuomo His updates are factual, informative, soothing, practical and, yes, folksy, as he weaves  Old Italian sayings, family experiences, HIS MOM etc. Reminiscent of AND as as good for the Nation as FDR's Fireside Chats. Trump? The POLAR OPPOSITE  …
What an incredible difference listening to this self congratulatory #PressConference as opposed to the fact based, calm, steadfast leadership of @NYGovCuomo
Trump's making another one of his "speeches" right now. All I'm saying is we are lucky it's Saturday and the markets are closed. That leaves plenty of time for us to hear from the real leader in this crisis, @NYGovCuomo and settle everyone back down.
#Trump Please watch how @NYGovCuomo  and control. Gov. Cuomo doesn’t belittle or attack anyone during his press conferences. Cuomo is direct, calm and supports his messages with data. We sense he cares and wants us safe. This is leadership!  …

Thank you. I feel for you & the people of New York. I just checked the Johns Hopkins interactive COVID19 tracker, 2pm Sat. 3/21. You have 10,356 confirmed cases. You aren’t hiding numbers like trump tries to do by not testing. My heart goes out to New York.
I think @NYGovCuomo and @GovLarryHogan are doing an excellent job. Competence can be bipartisan.
Watching @NYGovCuomo & wishing @GregAbbott_TX would lead our state of Texas this way! Day 7 w/a grandchild w/presumptive #coronavirus & little to no medical guidance whatsoever. #WhereAreTheTest #DemCast
Why does @NYGovCuomo have pressers abou C19 everyday and @realDonaldTrump have daily pressers about the press?
I mean, I'm literally listening to his presser as speak - he's hopeful and @NYGovCuomo has consulted with / agreed with his health officials to administer  in hospitals. So.... Not trying to start a "spat" here
It’s possible that no New Yorker has done more mental health harm in recent years than @NYGovCuomo, who blocked the #HALTsolitary bill & subjects tens of thousands in solitary to a high risk of psychosis, hallucinations, self-mutilation, and suicide every  …

Now more than ever, incarceration can mean death for too many NYers. So why is @NYGovCuomo pushing for bail reform rollbacks that would send thousands more legally innocent NYers to unsanitary jails and exacerbate the pandemic? We need MORE freedom, not less.

Have been surprisingly pleased with @NYGovCuomo this week. The leadership New Yorkers are looking for in these times and hoping the consistency sticks around.
#CuomoForPresident? As a New Yorker, I believe @NYGovCuomo is smart and rationale even if I do not agree with many of his policies. Much  than Biden and Bernie. Not sure what @TheDemocrats were thinking.
Inspired by @NYGovCuomo, @CSiriano, and @marklewismd, our family and friends, many of whom are in #quarantine due to their older age(s), have started making washable masks for our local hospitals and areas of need in the Fort Myers / #SWFL area! #Floridalockdown 
Maybe it's just me, but I feel pretty good that @NYGovCuomo and @GovMurphy got things under control. Actions and strong direction from them. We'll get through this.
"I accept full responsibility”- @NYGovCuomo “I don't take responsibility at all” -tRump See the difference? @JoeBiden: "In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth & takes responsibility" 
Good holy lord!! Compare @NYGovCuomo #CoronaVirusUpdate to the trump administration, it couldn’t be more diametrically different! Boy did we lose bigly by allowing this #IllegitimatePresidency to go forward.
In times of trouble, we look toward our leaders for truth  @NYGovCuomo instills confidence and trust, speaks truth and provides factual information. He stays calm and treats people with respect. He is showing by example what true leaders do. #CuomoForPresident
Want to see a politician who has mastered both talk & walk? = Check out the feed of @NYGovCuomo = one has to feel confident that with this type of a leader, the Empire State is going  out as good as it can from this calamity
Yay truckers! Our truckers are so under appreciated for all they do to keep our economy moving.
Pay them. They have expertise, student loans, rent, need to eat, and are losing hours like everyone else.

I did my yoga routine listening to @NYGovCuomo’s LIVE presser today, bc despite all the difficult news, I find his leadership soothing & reassuring. I love how he urges NYers to be more humane and to practice kindness, esp towards cashiers, medical staff, transit & delivery ppl.
Couldn’t agree more we need a leader like Cuomo to run this country! He would rock as president
K. Listen to TV doctors while your reality tv wreck of a "president"'s ignorance leads to even more deaths. #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
What leadership sounds like. @NYGovCuomo  …
With state orders for “non-essential” businesses close, states should impose tax on online order giants (Amazon, Walmart) & distribute to local businesses These big corporations are set to make even more $as local shops are forced to close. Redistribute @GovMurphy @NYGovCuomo

like @maddow said last night, #TrumpVirusCoverup should no longer be broadcast, he & #Pencedemic will kill half of this country. put your faith in local government @NYGovCuomo is leading the charge thank the dear lord!  …
#CuomoForPresident is trending. Cuomo is a corrupt bully and would be a terrible candidate. But it highlights how disastrous Biden's lack of visibility has been during the crisis. This was his chance to look presidential. He's ceding that chance to Trump and New York's governor.
I just want to say how great Mario Cuomo was raising two of the best political figures of our generation! @ChrisCuomo and @NYGovCuomo what a real blessing! Thank you!
I also appreciate hearing @NYGovCuomo ‘s press conferences...  …
@NYGovCuomo has been awesome for the entire country as far as leadership .
Can't wait for that @HarvardHBS LEAD case on @NYGovCuomo for us to all learn from.
In times of crisis, leaders step up. @crystale and @sacca are matching $250k donations to @DonorsChoose. @NYGovCuomo has kept us informed from the frontlines. And @dianakander and @JasonKander are poised to settle the great Beard Debate of 2020, because that’s what leaders do.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters he has requested field hospitals with 1,000 beds to be placed in Manhattan's Javits Center, and that he is looking at other locations for field hospitals  
@maddow said it best- stop live broadcasting these WH briefings filled with lies & hatred. We need facts & useful information. We’re in a crisis. @NYGovCuomo gave real information. When is FEMA, CDC or other health & science agency giving briefings?
Proud of @hickeyfreeman and the coordination with @NYGovCuomo team. All hands on deck.  …
I echo @NYGovCuomo:NY Congressional deleg. needs 2 address this issue & do it now. Where was @AOC when this happened? She should've been doing her job. Instead, she's soliciting campaign $by emails & tweets for @BernieSanders, her campaign & others. We need results not 
. @NYGovCuomo Agreed. Why don’t you practice humanity by releasing people in NYS prisons before anyone dies? 
How about this? @JoeBiden is going to give briefings starting Monday. Have @NYGovCuomo @GavinNewsom @GovInslee @GovMurphy and the other proactive governors others join. It's clear the federal gov't is incapable.
#MomsWickedTruth my 91 year old mother says “This is a war, the restrictions here a like a war. But, he wants everyone to feel good. He’s bullshitting everyone. At least Cuomo tells the truth. Everything is not hunky-dory. He is the hoax. He is not a real president. #TrumpHoax
I would prefer to vote for every single one of the homeless people who moved into state-owned vacant housing in California than Andrew Cuomo and they are showing more leadership than he is, perhaps we should cover THEM more  …
Andrew Cuomo > Donald Trump

 … Washington Post: US intelligence warned Trump in January 
Cuomo gonna burst out of Biden’s chest at the virtual DNC like a xenomorph.
Governor Cuomo called and Siriano ANSWERED!!!! MANY BLESSINGS TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF for rising to the challenge to protect our healthcare workers! 
I hope @NYGovCuomo keeps giving his NY press conferences everyday. Because, 1) Cuomo can actually speak & gives useful info & 2) it makes trump miss his tee times.
Cuomo: New York State is right now sending 1 million N95 masks to New York City. Pence: We’ll let you know on Monday what we’re planning to do about trying to get equipment produced and distributed.
Thrilled to report @NYGovCuomo classified "farmer's markets" as vital businesses that can (must!) stay open as other businesses are shut down. Markets, including @GrowNYC #Greenmarkets are vital to food supply; this order keeps thousands of farmers & workers employed!
I’m paying more attention to @NYGovCuomo than the potus! I’m assuming everything this admin is saying is fake and propaganda, during these daily rally substitutes for trump, the only person I pay attention to is Dr. Fauci. #FlattenTheCurve #StayAtHome #SocialDistancing
We would not be in the trouble we’re in if @POTUS had taken action in January when he knew what  instead of downplaying it for 3 months and calling it a hoax, so no.
. @NYGovCuomo, the last thing we need to do is to return to a broken system that reinforces racial injustice &  Bail rollbacks will harm thousands of ppl who are already vulnerable during this crisis. Leave the current bail reform law intact. 
I wish Dr. Fauci could do the daily press conferences with @NYGovCuomo instead of with propagandist-in-chief. Trump has done more harm than good. I agree with #Maddow network should stop airing his press conferences and only air factual info from him (so  …
This is Trump’s fault when he was saying “Irs like the flu, go to work, I’m going to have rallies, it’s going to be zero, everyone gets the flu, it’s a hoax”. That is why no one is listening!
Sorry @MSNBC I’m going to do as @maddow requested. I watched @NYGovCuomo , who was excellent, but I’m refusing to watch @realdonaldtrump stand before America and lie. Our #msm need to remove him from air time. He is causing people harm and that is unacceptable. @CNN @ABC @CBS
Cuomo, unlike other politicians, isn’t afraid of the numbers hurting him. He wants true data, wants testing available to all. While I don’t agree with all that he does as a politician, hats off to him in this case.
Democratic Reps are always better at taking the lead in times of crisis. We can look to NY with @NYGovCuomo, @GovMurphy in New Jersey, @GovNedLamont in Connecticut, @GavinNewsom in California, @GovInslee in Washington State, @TomWolfPA of Pennsylvania, @GovWhitmer of Michigan
Completely opposite. Cuomo speaks from a knowledge base and from the heart. Few notes needed when Cuomo speaks.
On Sunday @NYGovCuomo wrote op-ed in the @nytimes urging Pres. Trump to deploy the Army Corps of Engineers to NY to help build temporary hospitals. After the WH deployed, the Army Corp & ny health officials inspected more than a dozen sites,  4, & Gov will visit  …
Andrew Cuomo gave his daily coronavirus news briefing on Saturday, and the presentation – both in style and substance – could not have been more different than what the American people have been seeing from the White House.  … via @politicususa
Honestly I don’t envy political leaders... I feel they are all there for their own reasons.... but I have been proved wrong by our Governor Andrew Cuomo.... everyone sees how transparent he has been and updating on a day to day.... God bless Cuomo
These WH Press conferences are just propaganda and Trump rallies designed to help his "numbers." Compare it to the addresses by Cuomo, Newsom and Illinois governor.
Seriously,  fails. No one has the "liberty" to go out and spread infectious disease to others - whether done wittingly or unwittingly. "Private privilege ends where public peril begins."
This morning, @NYGovCuomo announced that the @JavitsCenter in Manhattan may  a field hospital for the testing and treatment of #coronavirus patients. (Photo © Ajay Suresh.)  
What’s the general consensus: Andrew Cuomo for Biden’s veep and then Cuomo 2024?
The only reason Trump is speaking right now is due to the informative  press conference Governor Cuomo just held. I'm not even a New Yorker and I'm watching him and my own Gov in order to get legit information.
Media, I beg you. This is useless propaganda and lies. He looks ill. Replay Governor Cuomo's briefing instead and turn this state news off. Please. You will literally save lives not airing lies.
Wherever you live, this briefing is worth watching. You get a chance to breathe and understand rather than panic. Pick this over @realDonaldTrump 's content-free daily spectacles. @NYGovCuomo provides data and specifics. #PresidentCuomo  …
Andrew Cuomo has presided over multiple hospital closings and been the target of protests from the ACTUAL heroes you should listen to in this crisis, New York's nurses, for YEARS.  …
Only 15% of NY coronavirus patients have been hospitalized, according to @NYGovCuomo. "15% rate of hospitalization is not a bad number ... It’s actually down from where it was." 
When @NYGovCuomo talks about supplies he names AMOUNT, Where and WHEN to expect delivery When @NYGovCuomo speaks he carefully delineates when he is giving an opinion and when FACT
When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When all you have is police, everyone looks like a black person not following social mores. @NYGovCuomo Raise taxes on the WEALTHY to get revenue, instead of fining WORKERS. Link to call script to follow!  …
Today New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made a profound statement. He said, "We are all first responders. Your actions can either save or endanger a life." Remember that quote through this challenging time. ALL of us are responsible for Public Health. #covid19nfld
I would definitely support @NYGovCuomo for President if he should choose to run in the future. He's been quite impressive and definitely a needed voice leading the contrast in messaging from @realDonaldTrump . Leadership done right.  …
Or.... and hear me out, the federal government should be doing this also because not all states have the means or leadership that New York does.
Don't forget the zookeepers!!!!
I've stopped watching him. I watch @NYGovCuomo instead.
"If @NYGovCuomo says we need masks my team will help make some." - @csiriano. Yesterday the NYFW designer and his full sewing team began working with the NYS Governor's office to make prototypes of masks to be distributed to NYC health workers:

Trump hasn't tweeted or said Thank you to any of these people.
Where is the f--king SOCIAL DISTANCING? You know who doesn't behave like this? @NYGovCuomo - a real leader, doing everything he can to help - doesn't behave like this.
So @NYGovCuomo is saying NY is desperate for medical supplies and they are looking world wide for help and supplies. He is saying NY is ready to collapse. Trump says everything is under control.
Let’s get this trending #ActingPresidentCuomo
Is it too late to just elect @NYGovCuomo president? Seriously. Term effective immediately. #CoronavirusPandemic

Impressive by any measure. @NYGovCuomo  …
The point of a press conference during a crisis is to not only inform the public, but also to ease concerns and make folks feel that things will eventually be OK. @NYGovCuomo does that. @realDonaldTrump does not. I’d feel better if @VP led the briefings and Trump watched on TV.

When my Mom attended St. John's Law School, Mario Cuomo was one of her professors. When she needed emergency surgery, he made sure she was able to keep up on all her coursework. Now she's 90, and his son, #PresidentCuomo, is helping to keep her safe. Thank you so very much. 
Thank you. How about a rent freeze?
New York State is now testing more people per capita than China and South Korea! That’s an incredibly rapid rollout (and explains the huge spike in cases). Excellent work @NYGovCuomo! Other states need to take notice.  …

This is really important. Gov. Cuomo: 55% of NYS coronavirus cases ages 18-49. No false sense of security. Social distancing is paramount.
This is the key "The American ppl shld know what their govt knew but chose not to tell them" but @gtconway3d will #Trump's blind followers ever think he's egregious enuf to not vote 4 him? I can't see what value they see in him. Wld flw @NYGovCuomo vs him every time. #coronavirus

Do you need more hand sanitizer? I own a  and we can shift production to hand sanitizer
As Tяump is about to start another “presser”, keep in mind that virtually everything he will say is a lie. Disregard ALL of what Tяump or Pence says. #DrFauci knows what’s real & says it. @NYGovCuomo, @GovInslee & @maddow are also good 
Same here in North Carolina. His daily briefings are  not bc the news is good but bc he’s not afraid, he’s in charge, and he accepts responsibility for his hard decisions. Plus: facts, info, data. Reality.
Voting for @NYGovCuomo was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Down the road, I will support #CuomoForPresident right now I want @JoeBiden for POTUS. I'm thankful the majority of #NewYorkers Didn't listen to the #gunextremists or the far left about Gov Cuomo.

My diehard, republican trump supporting neighbor Tony (from Queens, 78) just called to tell me he's fallen in love with Governor Cuomo. #PandemicMiracles
Postal Carriers. I don't even want to think about the workouts they've endured as the US orders quarantine supplies on line for delivery. It must be like a Christmas holiday that just won't end. Say thank you to your postal carriers! They're literally doing heavy lifting for us.
We’re ready to start making hospital gowns, scrubs and whatever else is needed @NYGovCuomo just let us know where to send em #NYlockdown #nyccoronavirus #help #DoYourPart
. @NYGovCuomo I’ll help out. My thanks to them and here are some to add: Volunteer First Responders Churches serving meals to needy/elderly Landlords delaying rent payments for tenants employees Everyone in healthcare ecosystem sourcing PPE Who’s missing?  …
When I watch @NYGovCuomo I feel a bit better. I would like to see the Democrats draft him from the convention floor to be the POTUS nominee because this crisis has made it clear that he and Mike DeWine are the best suited of their respective parties to be the chief executive.
Yes, Newsom & Cuomo are doing a great job of updating, answering questions, calming like any good leader should be doing & unlike the guy in the WH.
Trump supporters' general ignorance/stupidity is infuriating. Do they know every brain fart doesn't need to be aired out? The red hats got to keep some of this ignorance to themselves.
Let's move all Corona briefings from the White House to Albany and Governor Cuomo.
Governor Pritzker @JBPritzker is showing great leadership for Illinois.
. @NYGovCuomo’s wording seemed in line with Dr. Fauci. We don’t know if this drug will be effective. That’s why you do trials. There’s no approved therapy (and NY has the most cases), so it makes sense to do trials in this state. That’s not false hope. That’s science.  …
You sir. Are doing a brilliant job. I trust you. A thousand times more than this fkin President! #CuomoForPresident
I called the Governor yesterday. Did you? He has the power to parole immigrants in detention. Be role models, @NYGovCuomo @GovMurphy #FreeThemAll #ParoleThem @TornilloWitness @RAICESTEXAS  …
These press confs take the place of his cult rallies for feeding his ego... The rate of lies/min is staggering & undermines the credibility of the experts standing behind him! Best example of a decisive,  leader in a crisis: @NYGovCuomo’s daily briefings.
New York is beautiful however they have Cuomo Schumer and de Blasio who have ruined that state
Leadership means sometimes being a “shipping clerk”. Thank you @NYGovCuomo for showing real leadership.  …
. @NYGovCuomo says rising positive tests for the #coronavirus are a good thing, mirroring statements made by White House Task Force Dr. Deborah Birx from earlier this week. More:  …
Because we test. I'm guessing rocket science isn't your profession
I guess the Trump method of not testing people to keep official case numbers down was the way to go. You know cause it’s a scoreboard.
Did you just read what he said? They’re testing the most, so that’s why they would have most cases.
Joy Reid reacts to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's daily coronavirus news briefing: "Boy, I cannot imagine a greater difference with the presentations daily that are given by the president of the United States." #ctl #p2 
6,000 out of 7,000 cases right now in NY are NYC / Westchester and Nassau. The response is proportional to need. You want supplies for 1 million people when you have 1,000 cases in all of upstate and WNY? This no time for upstate/downstate politics.
A lot of people who follow me and my politics were surprised I supported Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon in 2018 but this crisis is why. An executive position requires experience. Voting for Cuomo was an easy choice for me
We can help! We've started producing masks in our race shop to extend the life of N95 masks:  … DM for info!
Yep. Governor Cuomo capitulated when he invoked the number of flu deaths. That is disinformation first peddled by Trump. The fatality rate of the flu is .1% or .001. For cv19 it the death rate is 20 to 30 times greater. A dangerously false equivalency.
EMTs and Paramedics as well. We are in patient’s homes treating, stabilizing and transporting these patients to hospitals.
Today @NYGovCuomo said he won’t release people from state prisons to pre-empt the public health crisis there. Only after a crisis kicks off there, will he respond. This decision is against all public health  & his own actions elsewhere. Shameful. We see you. 
You know what he didn’t do-stop NYC fr traveling to their summer &country homes.They came up in caravans, with Uhauls and the virus. The Catskills is a very rural and poor area. Avg age 75 THERE ARE NO HOSPITALS HERE. This am,the very first case of COVID 19 appeared in Roxbury
They could suspend rent and mortgage payments during the shutdown too. If everything is shut down, nobody is really losing out.
Yes! Watching @NYGovCuomo and looking forward to @JoeBiden . #BoycottTrump
Preparing lessons, searching for online books and  with students and parents, mailing books to our students, grading and offering feedback via google classroom while we are home.
If hospitalization rate is 15% @NYGovCuomo turn off the cell towers. Risk happens in the future, with Nature you get punished in real-time. Turn off all wireless in NYC to help stem the pandemic by raising immune redox power and lowering cytokine storm Somebody had to say it 
#CuomoForPresident Just got done watching New York’s Governor @NYGovCuomo and I am just left in wow. Andrew Cuomo’s leadership & patience on leading his states people is amazing. That energy Reporter: have you been tested? Cuomo: Nope, bc I don’t want to waste any test 
This man ( @NYGovCuomo ) is doing an exceptional job. I especially appreciate his willingness to say "I don't know" when he doesn't have the facts. Takes strength to do that.
"We don't have a significant issue of spread of the virus in prisons YET" @NYGovCuomo says. "If we have a problem THEN we'll address it". Again, the incarcerated are not a high priority for this Governor. We need to be taking a proactive approach, esp. by releasing our elders.
PLEASE RT and tag your own governor, senators to ask them block this in your state or stop it form  a federal mandate. This is terrifying. @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @NYGovCuomo
Question @NYGovCuomo: if you’re at a #Covid19 press conference claiming to be a part of a legacy of officials who best know how to save lives, then how do you explain this? &how do you explain the 23K ppl that have died from preventable OD during your tenure? #LetThemGo  …
Honest question, #WhereIsJoeBiden The only national leaders I see right now are Governors ( @NYGovCuomo @GavinNewsom @GovPritzker) Reps ( @RepMaxineWaters @AOC) and Senators @brianschatz @ewarren (who isn’t even running for President) Why is our presumptive nominee silent?
54% of New York State COVID-19 cases are people age 18 to 49 - @NYGovCuomo
Interview with New York Governor @NYGovCuomo on @CNN with brother/journalist @ChrisCuomo @cnnbrk @andrewcuomo @CNNnewsroom 
@NYGovCuomo is my new president #PresidentCuomo
In a time like this the real leaders emerge, Andrew Cuomo is a real leader and NY should be very proud.
It’s not ‘all about preventative care’. It’s about help where there are ACTUAL PEOPLE DYING. You have the supplies you need for now. We don’t. How selfish can you be????
As an equally hard-headed, stubborn, proud boomer - I agree. No one - at any age - is immune from contracting/dying/impacting the health/lives of others. Follow @NYGovCuomo guidelines/rules. Be smart/stay healthy.  …
Your leadership is shining through as is @GovInslee Most governors are except for the few kooks - naming two: @GovRonDeSantis @GovStitt
I agree about @NYGovCuomo. There is a marked difference between how he and DeBlasio update the masse. That said, I’m saving all my #ResignNow hopes for the #OrangeKingJoffrey  …
Our state & nation are in tough times & our everyday routines have changed causing stress & anxiety damaging to our mental health. I applaud @NYGovCuomo for putting out a call for therapist & psychologists to volunteer. Contact  to help #NYStrong
IKR? I keep listening to @NYGovCuomo problem solving and reassuring the public and I keep wishing he were the president instead of that #ToxicHateYam. I live in Florida but I'd vote for him in a #NYMinute! #DeSantis is trying to kill Floridians, he hasn't done anything at all.
And the thousands of School Nutrition Professionals who are feeding our 
This is #leadership. Thank you. How about expanding drive-through/walk thru testing? And don’t forget Rockland County - as of yesterday we had 230 cases & 3 deaths.
Hello @CDCgov @ScottGottliebMD @CNBC @VP @POTUS @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @GavinNewsom Is this a responsible thing to be saying in light of recent lockdowns, PPE shortages, and exponential growth? This man is willing to kill your citizens to keep his factory open.  …
New York State Strong: a great message from @NYGovCuomo. #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic 
Teachers are home
Watching @MSNBC this morning has been helpful. Glad to see leaders like @KamalaHarris @RepValDemings & @NYGovCuomo on there leading, w/ a focus on specifics & 
Thank you for doing Trump's job for him! #CuomoForPresident
. @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo shld thank Trump for providing them cover to hide their lack of ldrship & crisis management. The fed Gov HAS failed. So has de Blasio & Cuomo. Advocacy groups & healthcare providers are desperately trying to help & expose where action is needed.
Garbage collectors too
De Blasio was asked at a press conference why he was going to the gym when telling other people not to mix and he said “I have to be healthy to take the decisions for New York” Quarantine Trump and de Blasio put @NYGovCuomo and Dr. Fauci in charge nationally, we’d be better off
Of course also, the present expansion in NYC reflects the feed through of open mixing from irresponsible @BilldeBlasio - insisting on open schools, going to the gym, propagandizing on @Trevornoah show. The city shutdown @NYGovCuomo managed for us came after that.  …
Gov Andrew Cuomo telling people the truth whether they want to hear it or not. Meanwhile, Trump is going full Alex Jones / Jim Bakker, peddling unproven "cures" and just saying anything he thinks will make the stock market (or his polls) go up.  …
It also has the highest number of people in the densest populations. Anything else, genius?
How about this guy? If anyone needs to go, it's *45 
I'm in CNY. I know Andrew Cuomo. If we or WNY have an outbreak, he will be all over it. He knows we're here but the crisis is NYC with 10,000 cases. Ease up.
@NYGovCuomo will save thousands of lives from the bold actions he took yesterday. NY state’s protocols will allow the economy to function while minimizing risk for all Americans. It is a model for other states. The Governor has shown tremendous leadership during this crisis.
The media should continue to air Cuomo's briefings and stop airing *45's. Maddow was right last night.
They should be tested 100%
“You’re not Superman and you’re not Superwoman”: 54% of New York Coronavirus cases are ages 18-49, Gov. Cuomo says  
Thank you all! And thank you Governor for your excellent leadership and clarity during this challenging time. Have you ever considered...nevermind. We’ll talk when this is over! @NYGovCuomo  …
Thank YOU for being a voice of reason, calm,  who deals in facts and truth. This is what leadership is.
President Trump has earned praise from critics amid the #CCPVirus crisis: — Gov. @GavinNewsom: “Every single thing he said, they followed through on.” — @NYGovCuomo: “He’s being very creative and very energetic, and I thank him for his partnership.”  …
Cuomo praised Trump's coronavirus response. You're dumb. 
Incredibly impressed with @NYGovCuomo right now. Really stepping up and rising to the occasion. Very grateful. DeBlasio should resign as he is clearly incapable of handling this crisis.
Governor Cuomo touts the potential of HydroxyChloroquine in treating the Chinese Virus — the same drug @realDonaldTrump has hailed and fast-tracked! This could save lives!
Please RT widely if you’re a NYer and you depend on your #bicycle for work, basic transportation, or exercise. This was the right decision by @NYGovCuomo after cycling advocates like @BrooklynSpoke and news outlets like @StreetsblogNYC took on the  …
Please gather together the Governors and you guys take over!
Today @NYGovCuomo most assuredly states that his Doctor in charge Dept of Health agrees with @realDonaldTrump on the medley of drugs to use patients who are ‘serious’ see if they help! ‘Hope is good and what we need’! @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @CNN @MSNBC so where you 
There ARE masks/PPE out there. Every time someone contacts me i send info to @NYGovCuomo team who processes it immediately. Wish we had the same leadership in the White House. I’m still waiting to hear back on how exactly @realDonaldTrump is invoking Defense Production  …
How is a leader supposed to act during a crisis? See: Andrew Cuomo.
Gov. Ned Lamont of CT is doing an equally stand-up job for our state's citizens. He has pushed businesses to convert to making med supplies, asking home volunteers to sew masks, and shut down all non-essential businesses. (Sorry folks, no hair cuts.)
I don't even live in NY but am SO thankful for YOU and all you are doing  and your own humanity, which is lacking in the White House. Blessings to you.
A great list! I would also add mail carriers and package deliverers.
Just when you think cynicism has taken over politics, it's inspiring to see @NYGovCuomo step up -- this is 'old fashioned' leadership based  duty, focus, fearlessness, and a selfless public service approach that inspires and assures people during a crisis, thnx Gov
Dear @NYGovCuomo Thank You for delivering an informed  press conference with leadership! It is bringing a sense of calm and hope that my family and mother in law need in New York! I think ALL Americans want that but I know your focus is NY so Thank U & your staff
Liquor store employee!
Farmers
Sanitation Workers! #DSNY
Mail carrier.
And you Cuomo!!
Daaayyummm! @NYGovCuomo just said government not about celebrity, who tweets the most or who has the most twitter followers. It’s about who can do the job. LOL! 
. @NYGovCuomo: remember "humanity." Remember to find our "better selves". Amen... #coronavirus
We are watching @NYGovCuomo He is setting THE example that all of us should be following. I wish that more of our government  with us the same way that Governor Cuomo does. #Cuomo2020
In Opinion Jennifer Senior writes, “If the public wants factual news briefings, they need to tune in to those who are giving them: Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.” 
Thank you @NYGovCuomo for your steady,  leadership. And thanks to your dedicated team. You’re all showing the world that we still have leaders that care.
Gov Cuomo not just gives New Yorkers hope..it spreads across the country as the wind blows...im in Texas and i thank him for his honesty and facts
I hope @NYGovCuomo considers running for President one of these days. He's doing a phenomenal job and as an adopted New Yorker I for one am enormously grateful.
Governor Cuomo touting malaria drug as potential treatment for Wuhan coronavirus. Will the media skewer him for offering “false hope” as they did with President Trump yesterday?
Hey New York, I think you sent the wrong New Yorker to the WH. Please tell Mr. Cuomo to report to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and let us know where to return the host of celebrity apprentice. #PresidentCuomo #TrumpMeltdown
He's setting a good guideline for other governors to follow since there is no  from the White House.
Everyday New York Governor Cuomo outshines and out-presidents Trump. These days we get a truly presidential press conference at 11:30am ET followed by a mockery of one at 12:30pm ET. #PresidentCuomo #CoronavirusPandemic
This is a Democrat - @NYGovCuomo making the strong case for the sheer power  functioning government. It can never be replaced.
Watching this @NYGovCuomo #Covid19 briefing. It’s straightforward. Detailed. Factual science-based and statistical information. No yelling. No berating of reporters. No snit fits. No rants. Refreshing. #AndrewCuomo #Coronavirus #Pandemic
What this really shows in the importance of having an experienced and knowledgeable Governor in each state. I applaud @NYGovCuomo @GovInslee @GavinNewsom @GovWhitmer and so many others. If your Governor is doing well during this crisis then give them a shoutout
Cuomo is leading the nation.....THANK YOU!!!! @realDonaldTrump are you taking notes????
How do we help get doctors and nurses protective gear? @NYGovCuomo @sloan_kettering
Watching @NYGovCuomo live right now. He continues to be absolutely remarkable, the kind of leadership of which we dream and almost never get. And a bonus: a plainspoken Queens-born boomer who went to Fordham who's lucid, frank,  empathetic and inspiring.
This @NYGovCuomo press briefing is a model for what strong, empathetic, informative, specific, confidence-building leadership looks like. The contrast with the White House briefing room could not be more stark.
As a hard-headed, stubborn, proud millennial, I’m the last person to knock the younger generations...but @NYGovCuomo is 100% right. If you  with safety measures, you risk infecting yourself and others. You are wrong. 
NEW: @NYGovCuomo/ @melissadderosa says that the 90-day moratorium on lenders and landlords from evicting or foreclosing on those unable to pay will be formalized by executive order today.
Thank you, @NYGovCuomo , for being the leader we need. Hey, @realDonaldTrump — pay attention to how a true leader gets things done. Stay safe everyone!
If you're my age you need to listen to @NYGovCuomo . He's right. Don't be stupid and don't be selfish.  …
Yes it’s crazy and just mean. Can we just get all our information from @NYGovCuomo from now on? He makes so much more sense, is so much more candid and instills so much more calm in ppl than  out of the WH. #CuomoForPresident
I'm from MA but love listening to your news conferences. It calms me down a lot in these extraordinary times. Thank you!
Wait til spring breakers to   …
Seriously, right? He’s like a balm on the soul after being lied to and gaslighted by Trump
My friends wife has been sick in NY her dr hangs up she wanted a test -BULLSHIT this is shocking- WHY IS SICK YOUR NOT TESTING MR Cuomo is doing Great job Nu he is being lied to @NYGovCuomo 
Thanks for your leadership, Governor. God knows we need actual leaders now instead of corrupt reality-TV 
For 8 straight days the professionals tell us all.... DO NOT get a coronavirus test if you feel good...... Media: To @NYGovCuomo.. (Have you been tested yet?).... CUOMO calmy responds.... (NO, I feel great)..... 
Cuomo building calm, public trust. Enter Trump: 
Thank you, Mr. President!
I disagree strongly with @NYGovCuomo on so many issues, specifically life. But I want  him: he has been clear, consistent and has handled this crisis with the highest amount of grace imaginable. Props, governor.
Thank you @NYGovCuomo, @GavinNewsom and many other governors across the country for your hard work, your honesty,  and for reminding us what leadership looks like.
Yes but South Korea is following a model that is working! Once you flatten the curve you mass test and can put people back to work while quarantining those infected. Mass test production needs to be going on now with a National quarantine! Move people!
FYI Newsom does not get an hour of airtime daily like Cuomo, yet he an Inslee doing the work. Democratic governors are leading, who did I miss?  …
Listening to @NYGovCuomo describe in depth how to set up field hospitals, HVAC systems, and power capability is just so refreshing. He knows his stuff and has clearly immersed himself in finding solutions.
Does Andrew Cuomo want to run for President? I’m not saying he’s perfect. I’m not saying he would be my candidate. I am SOLELY asking the question about his aspirations.
The impressive thing about #Cuomo press conference today is facts - #Coronavirus cases increasing, with context - 34,000 ppl died from flu last yr; with action - sensing 1M N95 masks to #NYC. And then hope - “we will get thru this.
Wow. @NYGovCuomo, asked about the condition of vulnerable people in jails and prisons, just agreed he's "waiting to see what happens." That's not leadership. @JoAnneSimonBK52 @RAPPcampaign @nycmayor #clemencynow #freeourelders #letthemgo
Ugh, @NYGovCuomo answering the question about the health risks in prison says there's no problem "yet" and will be addressed if  up. Not exactly getting ahead of the curve on this key issue. He has a real blind spot here.
“Masks that normally cost 80 cents are now four dollars” says @NYGovCuomo on identifying 2 million masks around the world for purchase but says there is “price gouging”
Plus, at the Trump/Pence ones, they refuse to practice or model social distancing, all crowding around the podium. Look at separation @NYGovCuomo keeps between everyone, including reporters, plus the respect he shows reporters. He's modeling safe practice and who we should be.
“Perform as many tests as quickly as you can”— @NYGovCuomo. Great news for NY! The governor is right. But what abt US? Why isn’t @realDonaldTrump saying the same thing, every day? It’s his fault most states still can’t get enough tests. Like mine.  …
There are at least 10,356 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. About 15% of those cases are being hospitalized.  
Gov. Cuomo says that **people aged 18-49 years  54% (!!) of all #coronavirus cases** in New York. In #SouthKorea—that has widespread #COVID19 testing—nearly 30% of ALL cases are in people aged 20-29 years old. LOCK DOWN THE COUNTRY NOW  …  
Governor Cuomo's @NYGovCuomo presser is what pressers need to be both factual  He instills trust that  is in charge. He said we need to practice humanity:  gentility, and patience, and we need to thank our heroes.
Listen to @NYGovCuomo He needs to be our POTUS! Great leadership, honest, intelligent 
Plenty of empty @Lowes @HomeDepot buildings in NJ for mass casualties or future epidemics @PhilMurphyNJ @NYGovCuomo Can be turned into field hospitals or established respiratory care unit @RWJF @MeridianIntl @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @EpochTimesChina GB 
Gov. Cuomo just said we should all practice:  gentility patience So does that mean everyone can wear MAGA hats down the streets of New York now? Doubt it
According to @NYGovCuomo the “technical problem” in the House bill that passed stated that no state can get #coronavirus aid if they make changes to Medicaid. Cuomo is trying to make changes to Medicaid as part of the budget.
Cuomo is one of 49 governors scouring the globe. It’s Hunger Games,  with no centralized — one might call it united— effort. This is America’s first 50 state disaster. And every state on their own. @TheAtlantic   …
Maybe the reason @realDonaldTrump wants governors to handle the crisis is because he  close to being as credible and authentic as @NYGovCuomo. He hates being pulled away from golf. Can’t wait to get rid of him in November.
Inspirational press conference from @NYGovCuomo about #COVID19. Clear eyed  and straight answers. “show gratitude” “practice humanity” This is #leadership. Thank you! Sending love to our friends and all in NYC and frankly, everywhere right now.
Bread delivery from @RunnerAndStone by bike. Cargo bikes keeping this city stocked. All the more reason for @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo to ensure bike shops stay open as essential businesses. 
Thank you, Governor!
Big majority in this thread believe @NYGovCuomo is stepping up as a leader in the #Covid_19  …
"Practice humanity," says @NYGovCuomo.  gentility, and patience. Smile and say hello."
When I get on twitter after the president has given a press conference it’s a depressing mess. When I get on twitter after @NYGovCuomo has given a press conference it’s reassuring and encouraging, even when the news is not great (as it’s going to be for a while).
There's such a void at the top Cuomo's fire-sideish talk is standing out
"You'll never solve that neurosis," said @NYGovCuomo. I've just booked him as my therapist.
Cuomo has single handedly destroyed @realDonaldTrump in a way no politician, candidate, not even Obama, has been able to do and he’s done it without once mentioning his name. It’s called leadership. #PresidentCuomo @NYGovCuomo #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 
Breaking news: @NYGovCuomo says that a majority (54%) of coronavirus cases in New York are people between the ages of 18-49. Gov. Cuomo says  of social distancing is to blame. #pandemic #coronavirus
Listen up people. Right now advocates,  directly impacted people are spending nearly all our time *right now* fighting @NYGovCuomo’s efforts to repeal bail reform & send thousands more to jail. RIGHT NOW. My advice to him: Have a heart & stop this madness.  …
“I have not been exposed...I have no symptoms and I don’t want to waste the test” @NYGovCuomo on why he has not been tested for coronavirus.
Watching @NYGovCuomo press conference right now. He is calm, informative, factual, and informative. Crazy that the NY governor is better in this crisis than the president? Never new anything about him before this, but I’m impressed.
“There’s no reason to buy 100 rolls of toilet paper,” @NYGovCuomo
“We need 30,000 ventilators...we have 6,000,” @NYGovCuomo says. Adds that masks are a priority, and “searching high and low for gowns.”
Watching @amjoyshow & @JoyAnnReid politely cut someone off to race to coverage of @NYGovCuomo’s daily briefing. She cut to him like he was our president. Gotta say during this pandemic he’s doing a better job at that than the liar throwing tantrums in front of that seal daily.
I agree with @NYGovCuomo: If you see a healthcare worker, a grocer, a police officer, firefighter, pharmacist or any of the amazing workers getting us through this crisis—tell them THANK YOU! They are heroes.
We are the most powerful country in the world, but @NYGovCuomo says that "We are literally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies."
Thank you @NYGovCuomo. It’s refreshing to hear the truth and the reality of the COVID-19 crisis in your state. Your leadership is appreciated.
. @NYGovCuomo is schooling @realDonaldTrump on how to give a proper, substantive briefing on a fluid crisis situation. Cuomo’s presser is fact-filled, data-rich and gives us all the confidence that our state government is doing the job. @NYGovCuomo is a great leader.
I’m Canadian and I watch CNN sometimes and I’m very impressed with how he is handling this. He even makes ME feel better about the whole situation. His honesty and transparency & calmness. NYS is lucky to have him.
Trust me we are in FL I listen to Cuomo news brief , not the circus at the WH
I applaud @NYGovCuomo for asking psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists who are willing to volunteer their services to those having severe stress and anxiety over this crisis. Contact  .
Andrew Cuomo is doing one hell of a job stepping into the breach and leading during a crisis.  …
“We have a gown shortage statewide” says @NYGovCuomo “we need 30 thousand ventilators. We’ve got six thousand” he notes “we have made progress on masks”
Mental health is a vital part of public health. We're asking psychologists and therapists to pitch in and volunteer their services to help with New York's #Coronavirus response. To sign up, visit:  Stress and anxiety are very real.
BREAKING: @NYGovCuomo says new #coronavirus cases in NYC surge to 6,211 (new=1,803). Total in NY state = 10,356, and 15% need hospitalization. Cuomo predicts 40%-80% of population will be infected. NATIONWIDE LOCK DOWN NEEDED NOW #FlattenTheCurve #COVID19  …
I know I'm beginning to sound like a fan boy at this point -- but my word this is exceptional leadership by @NYGovCuomo
Gov Cuomo is presidential when we desperately need factual information and calm leadership. A wet, limp piece of lettuce could put Trump to shame.
A pic of our place: again not sure if 2,500-3000 sq ft of open space makes difference, but it’s yours if you need. we have 7 showers, 5 toilets, 5 sinks. 
As @NYGovCuomo is providing detail & excellent information, Trump is tweeting wildly about unproven drug therapy & announcing his press conference today, which, hopefully, no news organization will carry without real time fact checking.
First they tell us to Panic, now watching Gov. Cuomo pleading for people not to Panic?
Taking this amount of time in @NYGovCuomo daily presser to thank the front line workers is deeply appreciated. Our day care workers, our transportation workers, our first responders, our sanitation workers, etc. Their service is important to this city & we are grateful.
Never thought I'd see the day where I'm amazed by @NYGovCuomo's leadership skills. A far cry from meddling with the MTA's affairs. Meanwhile, POTUS continues to do nothing except yell at the media insead of answering asking softball questions.  …
Can someone tell @realDonaldTrump this is how you do a #CoronavirusPandemic press conference?. @NYGovCuomo does not slam reporters. Well prepared. GIVES FACTS. Does not go on “I have a feeling” 
Everyone on politicians but true leadership emerges in times of crisis. @NYGovCuomo #NewYork
Watch @NYGovCuomo He's a real leader. 
"Crisis brings out the best and worst of us. You rise to the occasion or you fall. There's people doing extraordinary work and they deserve our thanks. These are heroes. What selflessness and courage. Thank you." -- @NYGovCuomo #Coronavirus #COVID19 
You are so wonderful. Thank you. You are the best example of leadership we have. Thank you.
Thank You @NYGovCuomo Now We need Paid Leave, $2000/month, free medical care & NO Corporate bail outs.  …
In my view- @NYGovCuomo is our President right now.
NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s press conference right now should be required viewing for all Americans #CuomoForPresident
Watching you on msnbc today...man I wish you were my President....Andrew please consider the oval office someday...with a son living in NYC you give me hope...stay safe sir!!!
THANK YOU: @NYGovCuomo asking everyone to thank “everyday heroes”. Healthcare, groceries, pharmacists, childcare workers, police and fire. “Gives us perspective on how courageous Americans can be”
. @NYGovCuomo is not the President and can’t be today. As much as I’d like him to  the national #CoronavirusPandemic “czar,” NY State needs him where he is. But as a country, we need more leaders like him tackling & talking honestly about this public health 
. @NYGovCuomo “this is a time for a little gentility...a smile” urging New Yorkers to practice kindness in this crisis.
Cuomo: There are people who are doing extraordinary work and they deserve our thanks. Our grocer...medical professionals...pharmacists...cops..firefighters...bus drivers..they are extraordinary heroes. Gives us perspective and how courageous people can be.
Could you ask @NYGovCuomo to do it instead, please?
Grateful for @NYGovCuomo's press briefings. The daily Trump shitshows are a disgrace and anyone who voted for that orange buffoon should have their heads examined. #COVID19US #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiesPeopleDie @realDonaldTrump
Hey folks, New York is testing much more than anywhere else in the country. 54% of coronavirus cases in New York State are people between the ages of 18 to 49, according to @NYGovCuomo. And young people can spread the infection to older people they live with.
. @NYGovCuomo: Thank everyday heroes: Healthcare workers, grocers, pharmacists, police officers and firefighters, public transit workers, childcare workers (also sanitation workers) "This is public service on steroids."
New York Governor Cuomo’s daily briefings are like a master class in how we can all survive this #pandemic together. Every other local, state and especially federal leader should be taking notes. @NYGovCuomo 
Gov Cuomo is literally keeping me sane right now. Thank you!
Governor CUOMO @NYGovCuomo is fantastic.  skills are perfect.
Retweeting my pinned tweet as I listen to @NYGovCuomo. Hire your political leaders wisely, America. Be like New York.  …
Thank you @NYGovCuomo for addressing the social costs of the pandemic response. Another way to volunteer and help others. WE WILL COME OUT STRONGER, more connected and more grateful. I am feeling such love for our great state #NY and our country!
Confession: I look forward to watching Gov. Cuomo’s press conference every day. I get a kick how he talks about govt issues and then goes into a therapy session. #MyDailyConfessionDuringCorona
I’m watching @NYGovCuomo's press conference and recalling what he said about an #AB5-like proposal in NY: “When you have  issue like this - what happened in California and how do you make sure you don’t make the same mistake - it requires actual policy research.”
“You can have your own opinion, you can not have your own facts.” @NYGovCuomo telling it how it is. I would like this PowerPoint slide on a billboard please. #SocialDistancingWorks 
Great idea from @NYGovCuomo Who is a psychologist and therapist that can help during this time? We are  …
The presidency abhors a vacuum hence our new president, Andrew Cuomo.  …
“Your actions can either save or endanger a life.” - @NYGovCuomo
The generation that cries about boomers being stupid are the same ones going out and having fun during this time. Embarrassing.
This is what Trump could not answer yesterday. What to tell people who are scared? @NYGovCuomo is asking therapists, mental health professionals to volunteer to help others who are isolated and having issues. He is setting up a tele-system to assist New Yorkers. So pro-active. 
. @NYGovCuomo will be discussing opening a digital mental health center. God, I love this guy!
Now @NYGovCuomo setting up a network of therapists and other mental health professionals to help people get through this crisis. Asking for professionals to volunteer. All sessions would be electronic.
Announcement by @NYGovCuomo live right now: stress, anxiety and emotions are significant, and people are struggling as much with this as the economics. Calling for mental  to volunteer time. SPOT-ON and wonderful that he's acknowledging the psychological impact.
The  of Long Island and their families thank you.
Gov Cuomo of NY is  about Coronavirus . The guy just emits leadership .
Younger people listen up: 55% of NYS #Coronavirus cases are ages 18-49. Young people aren’t invincible. You can get this and you can give it to someone older you love. You shouldn’t endanger your own health & you certainly shouldn't endanger other people's health. #StayAtHome
I don’t think he’s doing everything right but I really wish @NYGovCuomo was prez right now.
Thank you Mr. President, your steady, necessary, and tough leadership has been  in these difficult times.
Can save @NYGovCuomo a trip. It’s really just roadways @NYCParks that are being overused by people seeking running/biking space. Could be solved immediately by opening some @NYC_DOT streets to people in the manner of #SummerStreets. @NYCSpeakerCoJo
. @NYGovCuomo says he wants to set up a network of voluntary psychologists and therapists to help people cope.
. @NYGovCuomo: is asking all psychologists and therapists willing to volunteer their time to contact: 
Watching @NYGovCuomo’s press conference this morning, with  of straight talk,  sense and hard information, could not be more different from the circus of  drivel and nastiness spewed by Trump yesterday. #leadership #trustexpertise
Who do you trust more to be in charge of the #CoronavirusPandemic national response: @realDonaldTrump OR @NYGovCuomo?
The de facto president @NYGovCuomo is speaking.
. @NYGovCuomo, appreciate your caring for the citizens of New York in this time of crisis, but please stop expatiating and this morning emphasize (hydroxy)chloroquine+azithromycin--encourage prescription and expanding supply. Covid-19 does NOT have to last months!
I don't even live in NY yet I watch Cuomo's pressers because  me. Straight talk, facts, & empathy--- just what is need now.
Possibly not now, but isn’t Governor Cuomo the leader we all need right now? “It depends on how responsible we are, how smart we are, how diligent we are.” Good advice & straight talk.  …
Listening to Cuomo and realizing that NY has Cuomo, CA has Newsome, WA has Inslee and we are f*cked in Florida with the guy who reads Art of the Deal to his kids.
“We are going to get through this” @NYGovCuomo “i believe it’s going to be a matter of months (not weeks) but we are going to get through this”
I say we all just write him in if he doesn't run, he is quickly gaining much respect from all over the country regardless of party affiliation. This is the man we need, under the most pressure he keeps showing up 100% and getting things done.
More than half of cases involve people under 50 years old, says @NYGovCuomo. This underscores the importance of young people following social distancing protocols.
Cuomo said “don’t make  down there.” Well, now you’ve done it. “I am going there today.” 
NEWS: The Governor is heading down to NYC later today to check up on all the young hooligans boozing it up on the Great Lawn, playing beach volleyball riverside, and chillin’ in the streets — start social distancing people, you’ve been warned by @NYGovCuomo
Yep. Cuomo's press briefings on NY COVID-19 response will  master classes in  in a time of crisis. Forthright, clear, humane even touching, he is someone who understands his responsibilities and takes hold of them fully. 
Pretty much everything @NYGovCuomo is saying can function as a response to @PeterAlexander's question to @realDonaldTrump about what an elected official would say to Americans who are frightened.
Thank god for @NYGovCuomo the steady leadership is what every american deserves. We will be in a better place at the end of this due to his leadership. #CuomoForPresident
Can we just name @NYGovCuomo and Dr. Anthony Fauci as the only two people in charge of the national response to #CoronavirusPandemic?
. @NYGovCuomo: "There's no reason to buy 100 rolls of toilet paper. There really isn't. And, by the way, where do you even put 100 rolls of toilet paper?"
“You can have your own opinion, but you cannot have your own facts.” — @NYGovCuomo during his daily briefing, which I now watch religiously. Thank you, Governor, for your steady leadership during these uncertain times. 
OK @NYGovCuomo is going out to the parks to monitor social distancing. I hope he finds the jogger who coughed on me last night because he was on his phone. LOL. But seriously. This has to be monitored because people aren't doing it on their own.
. @NYGovCuomo How did  up with that $6 BILLION that you want from the federal government. That happens to be the exact number of your budget deficit this year. NYC has the most virus cases in the country could it be that it's a Sanctuary city, like Seattle and San Fran?
BIG NEWS- @NYGovCuomo just announced NY is starting trials of hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax on coronavirus patients there. They’ve requested 10,000 doses from FDA and will start them as soon as they get them. #CoronaVirusUpdates 
NEW: 54% of #coronavirus cases in New York State are people before the ages of 18 to 49, @NYGovCuomo says.
“You can have your own opinion but you can’t have your own facts.” - @NYGovCuomo Preach!!!
It simply could not. Lots of people I know who were not fans have gained a whole new appreciation for the NY governor.
Don’t watch Trump. Watch Trudeau and pretend he’s talking to you.
Such a contrast in leadership between @NYGovCuomo and @realDonaldTrump & one thing is crystal clear: if Cuomo was in control of the fed response, less of us would die and less of the economy would have been destroyed. Which is why who is in charge matters.
Can’t say more about how impressed I have been with Cuomo. Data driven, prepared, strikes the right balance on messaging. Couldn’t imagine how much better a situation we would be in if he was president. #CuomoForPresident
Best @NYGovCuomo PowerPoint slide I’ve seen so far this week: “YOU ARE WRONG” 
Watching this  to me
. @NYGovCuomo says there is still  problem for social distancing among younger people
The contrast with Trump could not be more stark.
“Everything I know, I’ve told you ...you will have the truth” @NYGovCuomo 
Thank you for giving us the play-by-play with the actual numbers. It’s the uncertainty and the lack of clarity from the federal government that is freaking people out, so these stats are appreciated.
"There's no reason to buy 100 rolls of toilet paper," @NYGovCuomo says. #coronavirus
Thank you for your leadership, Governor Cuomo. It's great to see at least one elected official knows what the hell he or she is doing. Imagine that -- someone in charge who gives a rip about public policy and isn't worried about his money or next election. 
Huge news. Great job @NYGovCuomo!  …
New York City +1,803 to 6,211 cases, per @NYGovCuomo. Total New York state 10,356. Testing total is 45,437. 15% of cases requiring hospitalization. Still estimating 40% - 80% of population will be infected; goal is to slow rate of infection to give healthcare system time to prep. 
You are so appreciated. Facts, no BS
This is how the response should be done- Every state needs to follow your lead
Hey @realDonaldTrump THIS is how it’s DONE WHERE are the Test Kits!?? WHERE are the MASKS??
@realDonaldTrump take note!! This is how a real leader gets things done! Well done @NYGovCuomo
Cuomo, run for president. Not in 2024. Now
Instead of taking inspiration from the stellar #coronavirus leadership example on display for the nation by @NYGovCuomo, @realDonaldTrump will instead take the exact opposite approach and do the opposite, out of spite, jealousy and deep 
New York State is doing more #Coronavirus tests per capita than China and South Korea. We are doing more tests than any other state. So we know the numbers will go up. But that’s a good thing — we are identifying positive cases.
Confirmation from @NYGovCuomo - "the Westchester number is slowing and that's good news." Early and decisive intervention, declaring a hotspot. Testing. Quarantines.  …
Say what you want, but Cuomo is leading.  …
Can you be President now?
Gov. Cuomo being aggressive and showing what a real leader is like
thank you mr. president
HELP ME? Yup. I’m begging right now. This is the real deal. NY state democrats right now planning to jail more people. Please let @NYGovCuomo & @NYSenDems that now is not the time to jail more New Yorkers. Seriously. Please just @them. Now. Tell them #NoRollBacks on bail 
UPDATE: We are sending 1 million N95 masks to New York City. 500,000 N95 masks will go to Long Island. We are purchasing 6,000 additional ventilators and gathering supplies from every source we can get.
#CoronavirusUpdate: @NYGovCuomo said today that the state is sending 1 million N95 masks to NYC. We're going to need them. Also happy to see Javits is being considered to build more hospital capacity. 
I’m officially attracted to Andrew Cuomo. Can we just let him take over for the country? Wouldn’t that be bipartisan? Let’s do that!
Governor Cuomo gets a + 11 to Trump's -11 in both governing and human being.
We have no President.
Y’all realize that Trump is only doing daily briefings because @andrewcuomo is doing them, right? Trump knows he shouldn’t be at that podium. The Surgeon General could do them. But he hates that Cuomo is showing him up every day with respect to info & a somewhat calming message.
Ride on! @NYGovCuomo has apparently decided that bike repair shops ARE essential businesses. That's good news as cycling surges during the corona crisis. H/T to @DannyHarris_TA and 
Today we are traveling the state looking at locations for the Army Corps of Engineers to build new beds. Sites we're looking at: -Javits Convention Center -SUNY Stony Brook -SUNY Westbury -Westchester Convention Center
. @NYGovCuomo said he is looking at sites including the Javits Center, SUNY Stoneybrook to build field hospitals
. @NYGovCuomo: “We are literally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies.” #Covid_19
. @NYGovCuomo says they are looking to build out hospital space at Javits Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Westbury and Westchester Convention Center. State sending 1 million N95 masks to City today.
CUOMO FOR PRESIDENT!!!! HE'S THE FIRST LEADER WE'VE SEEN IN 3 YEARS @realDonaldTrump
He’s not my Governor but @NYGovCuomo is the true voice of  and honesty during this crisis. Hats off to him and his team.
President Andrew Cuomo is updating the nation right now. Vice President Gavin Newsom will do the same soon.
Shhhh @NYGovCuomo is on. He’s powerful and positive and people are looking to him for guidance all over this country. He’s Presidential. 
So weird how NY Governor Cuomo only gives useful and true information, and when he's done, there's no parade of sycophants to praise what a great job he's doing.
NYS @NYGovCuomo calls Dr. Anthony Fauci "an extraordinary American," says he's given him guidance. #coronavirus
Please don't forget about deaf ppl and add a sign language interpreter to your briefing panel.
"Compare this to Cuomo, who takes questions at his news conferences calmly and systematically..." @NYGovCuomo has been nothing  about @realDonaldTrump's #coronavirus management. What's "propaganda" is the #FakeNews 
Holding a briefing with updates on #Coronavirus. WATCH  …
We all agree!!! All @realDonaldTrump does is lie and behaves like a total imbecile!! Thank God for the medical professionals and people like @NYGovCuomo and others that keep us informed.  …
Just got email from our cat sitter / dog walker business saying they are being forced to suspend services due to NY “guidelines.” This should be deemed an essential service! Please help @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor
. @NYCMayor & @NYPDShea: please do better. Since I can’t depend on either of your leadership to do the right thing, I’ll be raising this too @NYGovCuomo today.  …
@GovKemp Take a lesson from @NYGovCuomo - protect your people and take control of this. #FlattenTheCurve
Mayor @RudyGiuliani: Impressive relationships b/w @realDonaldTrump, @NYGovCuomo, @GavinNewsom You can have a great General, but if he doesn't have an army, what's going to happen? NYC odd man out now #WarRoomPandemic Listen & watch  & @77WABCradio
Dear @NYGovCuomo, if we are making masks to donate, does your office have a list of those hospitals/providers most in need, or should we call our local facilities to offer help. Just want them to go where they are needed most. #thankyou #maskshortage #rallythoserhatsew #nyhelps
Licensed health care professionals across NYS, including my wife, have received this email from @NYGovCuomo. She says she will help any way she can. 
#JustIn: New York City is now the epicenter of #CoronavirusOutbreak in the US. The City reported 5,683 cases & 43 deaths so far - about 1/3rd of all #COVIDー19 cases in the US. In New York State, more than 8,300 people have tested positive for the virus. @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo
@NYGovCuomo @markpoloncarz @ECDOH Here's a NY MANUFACTURER - say they can do 2 million masks per day  … NEW YORK needs PPE -gloves, gowns, masks. Will pay a premium. Need Funding? 212-803-3100 Have Unused Supplies? 646-522-8477 #Covid19NY #WeNeedPPE
Albany is probably coursing with COVID-19. Legislators are testing positive. Cuomo's press office is testing positive. But @NYGovCuomo is still holding in-person press conferences, putting staff and reporters at risk. This is insane.
Upper East Side streets this AM in #Manhattan as I walk to the hospital to check on my patients. Thank you for heeding the advice of @NYGovCuomo, staying home, and letting healthcare providers do their job and help those in need. @WeillCornell @nyphospital #neurosurgery 
We learned yesterday that @NYGovCuomo has relented and lifted contraband rules prohibiting hand sanitizer in NYS prisons. People incarcerated at Great Meadow Prison have been producing the product for 26 cents an hour. Now he must focus on releasing as many people as possible. 
So impressed by Andrew Cuomo's leadership. If he'd shown it in years past, he would have been a strong candidate for president. Could be in the future.
NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo and CA Gov. Gavin Newsom praised President Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. ⁦ @realDonaldTrump⁩ loves and cares for all American’s ! He is Awesome ! We love @realDonaldTrump + Thank you to the Best President ever Do you agree 
. @NYGovCuomo has been the leader we need, especially when the President has deflected his responsibilities every step of the way. Thank you, Governor.  …
Those 3 Democratic Governors in populous states have strong chains  to seek and implement expert advice. The President's only instruction being sauve qui peut, so GOP governors are following Newsom, Cuomo & Pritzker. This is a textbook lesson in political leadership.  …
Just to be clear. Let’s stop broadcasting POTUS. Let’s clone @NYGovCuomo !  …
Pretty sure harassing people trying to get to their medical appts during a pandemic is not essential. @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor is there anything that can be done  …
a thought for @JBPritzker @GavinNewsom @NYGovCuomo et al: it might be wise to discourage/ban unnecessary home repairs/DIY projects during the #stayAtHome order. Inexperience + power tools, ladders, electricity => increased ER traffic. iow, a #dontBeADumbass 
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @GOPLeader @DavidLimbaugh @rushlimbaugh @Scavino45 @DevinNunes @DiamondandSilk @DHSgov @SebGorka @nypost @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson why is this story not out in media ? @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo  …
As a New Yorker I have so appreciated the demeanor & leadership from @NYGovCuomo during this unprecedented period of time.
Here is a list of hospital contacts for PPE donations and what they need : 
I’m a big republican, but @NYGovCuomo is doing a great job at battling the coronavirus! My governor @GovNedLamont is doing a terrible job and still have minimal testing.
@NYGovCuomo 500+ people on my site. No running water to wash only porta potties. Crowded outside hoists. How is this social distancing and essential. What about my family? #StopConstruction #coronavirus
"If @NYGovCuomo says we need masks my team will help make some," the fashion designer tweeted. "I have a full sewing team still on staff working from home that can help." 
We need to stop shaking our heads about this and saying how sad it is. We need to follow the @nytimes advice. Add @NYGovCuomo to that list. He’s been giving NYers the hard truth from the beginning. #Covid_19 #coronavirus
We are working on producing masks that we will DONATE to doctors and hospital staff with all of the excess fabric we have....I hope others members of my industry will work to do the same! Stacey Bendet @NYGovCuomo @chuckschumer
Today's cover: Cuomo orders lockdown, shuts down non-essential businesses  
Bike shops need to stay open, @NYCMayor, so that those of us who need to care for others can reach them. You promised to speak with @NYGovCuomo last night to add them to list of essential services--did you???  …
Let's just act like @NYGovCuomo and @GavinNewsom are President and Vice President (any order you choose) right now and ignore Donald Trump.
Our Firefighters and EMS personnel are running out of PPE dangerously fast!!! @IAFC and @ChiefGaryLudwig need help getting more to their stations ASAP!
Some advice to all the governors out there. 1- Watch what @NYGovCuomo does and then do the same 2- Watch what @realDonaldTrump does and then do the opposite
Hey @NYGovCuomo can you ask New Yorkers to stop going to central Maine and other rural areas? They’re possibly spreading the disease to areas even less capable of handling an outbreak.
Two very different messages when both held coronavirus briefings on Friday. Gov. Cuomo vs Trump 
Shipping millions of supplies from overseas is difficult  to do, but thanks to you all, we've gotten the contacts needed to make it happen. We are now prioritizing state agencies, hospital networks, then individual hospitals. We'll be working with @NYGovCuomo's office.
Here's the list of what businesses, not-for-profits, and services are considered ESSENTIAL under @NYGovCuomo's Executive Order 202.6 yesterday: (full list online, some highlights below)  …
Where is your apology for downplaying it until it was too late, @washingtonpost? Also, warning about it primarily as an excuse to attack a President you didn’t like (with a positive side effect)? Where is your criticism of the  @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo?
I think I speak for most "essential workers" when I say we WANT TO STAY HOME. Most of us are hourly, low-wage workers  (I take 2 trains and a bus) to our publicly interfacing jobs. While "nonessentials" workers get to protect their health. At least mandate hazard pay!
Release these children. Unbelievable. @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo  …
KCH in Brooklyn services people in Crown Heights, Flatbush & nearby areas. I was born across the street at Downstate Medical Center. These neighborhoods have a lot of Black folks - for now. KCH must receive the same supplies other hospitals receive. cc: @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo  …
I swear to God if this pandemic ends up making me like Andrew Cuomo...  …
During . @NYGovCuomo’s radio interview on the @seanhannity show he had nothing but praise for @realDonaldTrump. The two have gotten along famously. Right now, the two men from Queens are acting like Americans do in a crisis. Why aren’t you? #KAG2020
I don't have siblings... and I've been okay with that... but this interview makes me wish I had a brother or sister to mess with like this. BAHAHA @NYGovCuomo  …
There is a drug and France did the study and it’s been shown effective Get your facts

@GovMurphy @NYGovCuomo Murphy needs to take Cuomo’s lead and shut the state down. Retail workers are still being forced  to work where  in sick, touch everything, and lets be real,  don’t care.
Andrew Cuomo is acting like the president we wish we had.
Statement from Vice President Lightfoot urging Citizens to Comply with @NYGovCuomo directives

@NYGovCuomo's PAUSE Act, which shuts down 100% of non-essential businesses effective Sunday at 8 PM, does not apply to CDPA. Fiscal intermediaries and personal assistants are essential healthcare workers recognized by NY. Please share with anyone who may be concerned.

As an amateur WW2 historian, I think @NYGovCuomo’s ventilators=missiles metaphor  wrong and let me explain exactly why In this thread (1/167)
Maaaaaaan, New Yorkers! 80s, 9/11, Sandy, Covid 19...no matter what it is, y'all always pull together  through. I don't know why I keep getting surprised by this. We watch you with awe and admiration.Stay awesome, stay strong, and continue to be a source of

Agree He interrupted ⁦ @NYGovCuomo⁩ yesterday for 90 min to talk BS & nonsense because he’s jealous of Cuomo for doing a great job! There is NO MEDICATION ppl. Don’t believe his lies. He knows nothing! He needs to get us respirators & PPE though!  …

In mine its @NYGovCuomo . The governor pressers are the only ones that should be aired nationally because they actually provide facts and direction not disinformation and self praise/pity
I would like to propose a rotating leadership to help us get through this pandemic Monday: @NYGovCuomo Tuesday: @GavinNewsom Wednesday: @GovInslee We can rotate them again if needed. Anybody but the and no Seema Verma or Jerome Adams #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER
The thing is everywhere is going to take these steps. Do it one week earlier and you’ll save lives. And also you’ll be able to manage it and release folks from those sacrifices earlier. It’s a no brainer.
I still can’t get over Andrew fucking Cuomo rising to the occasion. This dude’s career thus far has been focused on destroying the MTA, scuppering progressive legislation from his own party, and a bunch more bad shit I probably don’t even know about. Yet here we are
Hi i am a congresswoman from NY. I can help you get in touch with Gov. Cuomo’s office for makes. New Yorkers need help thank you!
Thank you
We worked with the amazing folks at the Illuminator project 
Got a panicked text from a friend back in Queens. He's a construction worker on @NYGovCuomo's Javits expansion. Workers are getting called into work & can't buck the boss. My friend can't afford to get COVID19--left his tools at the job site & never went back. #StopConstruction
The silence is DEAFENING from NYC leftists not calling on @NYGovCuomo to #StopConstruction Too many of you act like construction workers' lives are expendable. Theres no reason why the only folks out here are @bradlander @JumaaneWilliams @cmenchaca workers & their damn families
Pathetic, but not shocking, you now tieing in your anti-vape rhetoric with the COVID-19 pandemic. Something that is actually hurting people around the world. Your shame knows no bounds. @GregTHR @schmidci @castello2 @whycherrywhy @ChaunceyGardner @staaacy1981

Honestly, I think DIY fabric masks are a better solution than 3D printed mask. They require special filament, and additional products to seal. I'm saying that as someone who 3Dprinted one and tried to make it work. IMHO, it's a really cool idea that just doesn't work very well.
@SenatorRomney @MittRomney Uh, I live in New York. We would love to have followed the South Korea model. Too bad we didn’t have tests, and now we are running out of masks, all PPE, ventilators and beds. Sounds more like Italy to me. If it weren’t for @NYGovCuomo we’d be dead
Sheltering in place, we need specific goals. How many hospitals will you build in this time? How many ventilators will you make? How many new healthcare workers can you train? Please make this worth it. Sheltering isn’t enough @GovInslee @MayorOfLA @GavinNewsom @NYGovCuomo
I have RN friends sewing masks as we speak. In Oklahoma.
. @NYGovCuomo @MayorBarlow and @OswegoCounty urge people to stay home, remain calm as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York topped 7,000 Friday. Cuomo announced “drastic action,” including requiring all non-essential workers to stay home.  …
And so it begins: extreme shortage across NYC hospitals. Cuomo & De Blasio: “NY would need to double its available hospital beds to 100,000 and could be short as many as 25,000 ventilators”. every ventilator short is potentially another death.  …
Talk to your bosses.Keep at them. You have ratings clout. Don't let this drop. Air only addresses from health professionals and the daily briefings from @NYGovCuomo and other Governors. Give only a brief summary of the WH Task Force daily circus, if you must.

Jeffrey, just amazing!!! I can help direct you to folks if you have not heard back yet. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
Yes, we need to rely on our governors. We really don’t have a president. He’s insignificant. So far,NY Cuomo, CA Newsom, WA Inslee, PA Wolf (my gov), they & other govs are taking the bull by the horns. We’ll be stronger w/o Trump. On our own!

Instead of blaming China, do something ffs. Watch @NYGovCuomo, @GavinNewsom or @JayInslee for tips on how to govern. And get our hospital workers masks and PPEs instead of trying to impress the disaster in the White House responsible for the exacerbation of this global pandemic.

We can also listen to daily briefings from @NYGovCuomo He’s doing a great job of leading NY through this crisis. Clearly we can’t depend on leaders at the federal level - not to even be honest.
Thank you 
As of today @NYGovCuomo has shut down bicycle shops while subway is at risk. During Hurricane Sandy I was working in one and we kept workers delivering food, medicine, and organized relief supply runs. Please ask the governor to reconsider.  …
#RentFreezeNow Everyone in this apartment have lost our jobs because of this outbreak. We have no idea if or when we will be able to start up again and I know we aren’t the only ones. @NYGovCuomo push this rent freeze proposition or a lot of people will not recover anytime soon.
