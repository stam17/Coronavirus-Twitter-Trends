Lying about a meeting just to make @NYGovCuomo look bad.

Hey @NYGovCuomo Trump wants you to sue him. Please do so. He expects it.
I know. Especially when ImpeachedPotus hasn't been fact checked & found to be lying over 16,000x since taking office.

As a frequent Global Entry traveler Pres. Trump has continually shown his disdain 4 true democratic leadership. His abuse of power by instituting the SALT tax banning NYers from TTP is outrageous. I’m proud 2 support @NYGovCuomo in his efforts 2 bring Trump 2 justice once again
Cuomo and the New York state legislatures created this mess. If they had not enacted idiotic laws or policies that hindered other law-enforcement agencies access to DMV Files this would not have happened. Sharing DMV files is standard practice with all law-enforcement agencies.

Sorry Bob, look to yer buddy @NYGovCuomo as the reason, not POTUS...
When you can’t access DMV records it makes it very hard to get someone. You would think NY of all places would surely want to know  in.
No, they blocked it because Cuomo is allowing illegals in NY to get license & prevent feds from doing background checks on them. That means a terrorist can fly into NY, get a license, and roam USA  terroristic acts. Trump admin is protecting WE THE PEOPLE. LEGAL CITIZENS
I’m a tax paying NYS resident and I want to turn it Red!

How about simply cooperating with ICE by giving access to DMV data? Sometimes it really is just that simple.
You’re literally siding with illegals over citizens.

Building  underground system and then maintain on it should be free?? Let’s use logic next time.

Most mta members just fix and clean the trains cars, so that "fuck mta" one is really stupid
I guess if cops won't patrol the subway I won't be ever going back to nyc. I almost got mugged like 5 times when I had bad luck of working in nyc. never again am I going to that dirty city.
As far as I've seen, there are families that are trying to protect themselves from actual criminals that constantly rob them while the police have little to do for them due to not know who that person was. I don't think they're all bad people, they're just doing their job-
Cops don't have any legal obligation to protect you from those things.
Yeah. Public transport should be a free crime zone
And yet why drop the bail for people arrested. By doing so @NYGovCuomo And yourself just set any and all who break the law free..
Yep he is a punk. Always has been. Love to see him sit down with Chris Cuomo and play this card. He has an open invitation. Chris would love to interview him. His little balls would never allow him. Typical bully. Big tough guy with a women.
I in no way feel being mentally damaged makes you inherently bad. I have PTSD from multiple sexual assaults. Folks just need help. No one goes thru life unscathed...I feel bad for my bro AND my friends who are afraid of the police. I see both sides.
And then you're going  when you get mugged in a Subway tunnel due to the fact that there's no law enforcement there. But then again you're aren't very smart considering you don't understand what the word free means
The NYPD are criminals
