Thank you for your steady leadership Governor. Happy #easter to your and your beautiful family.
We know it is challenging but for those celebrating, #Easter in-person celebrations must be held with only immediate family members to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These are difficult times, but we stay apart to save lives.
Conservatives reduce blame to a zero sum game, and assume liberals do the same. Cuomo gets a B- in my book. That doesn't preclude Trump from getting an F.
Cuomo is being praised by the left for his leadership during this crisis. NYC makes up less than 3% of the American population, but they have about 45% of all the deaths. Excuse me... What would the numbers look like if were doing a bad job?

Again at your own risk. You can still do it but you better be willing to face the consequences, especially if you're going to put the lives of other people at risk.
1. That is categorically untrue. The White House strategy has been to push leadership to the states. @GovTimWalz @GavinNewsom and @NYGovCuomo have done very well. 2. The half ass WH response was at least two months late, magnifying the crisis. #trumpcovidfails
Or  sense at this point. Why would you go out and have dinner with mom and dad or grandma and grandpa? Do you want to take a chance to spread something that could kill them?
No. It's is strongly  that people stay home to stop the spread. But if you want to go to your religious gathering and risk your friends and family's health, it's on you. Good luck.

Trump failed to respond. But in January and February, it was clear coronavirus would hit NY. Cuomo and de Blasio could have instituted full lockdowns by early March when first cases appeared. Meanwhile, Washington State and California moved more quickly and saved many lives.
You handle situations differently depending on what it is. Virus spreads, heart attacks don’t.
The governors of California, New Jersey, and Illinois all issued shelter-in-place orders before Cuomo did. And now NYers are paying for Cuomo's arrogance
Pain relief or sedation.....not both.......that's sad......I choose pain relief I don't want to be sedated having pain that I  to anyone. That is torture.
The former head of the CDC told the New York Times up to 80 percent of the deaths in New York could have been averted if Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio reacted sooner to COVID-19. Over 8,000 are now dead. Liberals cling to the fantasy it's all Trump's fault.
@NYGovCuomo is the monster Americans need to fear!! He plays to the camera like he’s a Hollywood actor while banning and pushing through his selfish agendas!! He is EVIL.

You are absolutely right. There is no way that we can ever correct the wrong that COVID creates in our  Cuomo needs to stop fighting with the mayor. Buffalo and other school districts are closed for the rest of the year. Why are we any different

Ugh, you're scared of losing things when there are people in prison for a bit of weed or some other ridiculous offense during a deadly pandemic.
You should be scared that the answer is always carceral policy because people can profit off that. Be scared that the govt isn't properly protecting or providing for people in such a devastating time and that desperation will increase and that govt will continue wrong reactions.
You should be scared. But not of criminals, they're just people. You should be scared that people in govt think like you do, don't believe people are desperate from insufficient social programs or that they just make mistakes, like people do.
People in NY state are suffering and @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor are fighting an ego war as to who carries a bigger stick . Decision to close schools for the rest to the school year is the right decision.

Who has legal authority to close down @NYCSchools? That’s a conversation for people with time for largely academic conversations. I don’t have the time. I don’t have patience for petty back-and-forths in the middle of a deadly pandemic. @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor: Cut the crap.

Sources say @emmawolfe called @melissadderosa at 9:25 this morning to inform @NYGovCuomo office of @NYCMayor decision on schools. Mayor press conference was scheduled for 9:30. Mayor also reached out to Governor directly, but they did not speak prior to announcement.

oy vey. @NYGovCuomo reacts to @NYCMayor closing NYC public schools as "his opinion" and says it's his (the Governor's) call. Ok boys let's not fight on the playground. Why not talk this out before making public pronouncements? People are dying every day. and losing their jobs.
Today my family treated the SUNY Old Westbury Police to lunch as a HUGE THANK YOU! The campus is being turned into a hospital. Be Safe out there! @SUNY @SUNYOldWestbury @pbanystate @NYGovCuomo 
It’s wishful thinking on your part. Here in WA, with things far more controlled despite the first outbreak being here, the gov cancelled the [in person] school year days ago. The thought of N.Y. re-opening at any point this year is mind boggling.
. @NYGovCuomo & @NYCMayor need to get it together. Their pissing match is not helping New Yorkers! 
He never changes.  … As an aside, I want to know about Cuomo’s own social distancing because my hair stylist friends say he definitely got a professional cut very recently.

This is such a ridiculous/clueless narrative - the ballot deadlines have all passed - there is no plausible scenario where @NYGovCuomo gets delegates @JoeBiden will be the Democrat nominee for president and his VP pick will be a woman (per his own  …
Disappointing answer @NYGovCuomo re: nurses’ lack of PPE. If your liaison for information is hospital administrators, you will sadly be misinformed. They have never represented nurses & historically/currently set abusive policies/processes that undermine nurses = untoward effects
I’m really having a hard time understanding why certain residents in Midwood Brooklyn can gather by the hundreds with no arrests but this man in the Bronx was arrested while seemingly traumatized people shout “NO.” @NYGovCuomo. is it racism? help New Yorkers understand.  
Sick and Tired of the childish foolishness going on between @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo. You both work for us the people so sit down, shut up and listen. Stop auditioning for the next political office. Schools will be kept closed for the rest of the school year and that is it!! 
Sending @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor each a sourdough starter and some edibles and logging off this website for the weekend. We all need a break.
I find it funny how a major theme of his conference today was keeping politics out of this yet he contradicted Debalsio, referenced the Navarro memo, and referred to no one warning about covid in Jan and feb. This may have been the most political conference he has given
damn right #Cuomo  …
Listen to Governor Cuomo say this economic shutdown was preplanned event!!! They are lying to us! He accidentally told the truth!!! 
I know a few nurses and hearing the same. Hospital executives are covering up PPE shortages. Hospital leadership  infections, etc with staff.
@NYGovCuomo In your own words you admit that ventilators aren’t saving many lives. In all honesty ventilators prolong the agony & COVID19 death remains imminent. You scream for more ventilators but refuse to lift restrictions on HCQ. WHY? #CuomoIsAMurderer 
Bill de Blasio’s Press Secretary tells Governor Cuomo to fuck off @NYGovCuomo  …
The divergence in messaging from @BilldeBlasio - "Schools out" - and @NYGovCuomo - "not according to me, it isn't" - mirrors what happened w/ the "stay-at-home" order in March. Mayor said we should do it. Gov said not so fast. It ended up happening anyway, but Gov announced.
He’s fundamentally incapable of rising to an occasion like this, but sure, if he *had* then re-election would’ve been a lock. If Cuomo can boost his approval rating by 40, this Very Hypothetically Competent Trump would’ve pulled in the 10 or so he needs pretty easily.  …

Leaving aside the merits of whether NYC schools should be opened/closed, the dissonance between the messages of @NYGovCuomo and @BilldeBlasio this morning is really something.
BREAKING: Reporters press @NYGovCuomo on NY state prisons’ capacity to quarantine & if he’ll grant clemency to incarcerated NYers vulnerable to COVID. Cuomo: “Prisons have total capacity to quarantine...Not anything new [on clemency]” 1st answer is a lie. The 2nd is a disgrace. 
the press in new york lets cuomo repeatedly get away with bullshit because he personally calls them on the phone and screams at them like he’s seven years old. editors are afraid of angry phone calls from the second floor. let’s see if they cave again on this one.
He's not saying schools will reopen. He's saying the decision on schools needs to be coordinated between Suffolk, Nassau, NYC and Westchester.
 @NYGovCuomo for recognizing disconnect btw hospital admins & front line workers Front line docs, nurses have been vocal about disconnect for weeks now and governor would have best info to make decisions by speaking directly to docs and nurses!  …
Gov Cuomo asked why nurses saying they’re reusing N95 masks 20x “We ask every hospital everyday if they need anything. If there’s disconnect btw hospital admins & nurses, I can’t help with that now” My rec to @NYGovCuomo: Please speak DIRECTLY to front line nurses and docs! 
Trump rush to reopen society likens to lung cancer patient with one lung removed, who then does well in recovery with good prognosis. Eureka! So, first thing he does is go outside for a smoke. Stay home, wait for an anti-viral and for virus to dissipate.
This is petty and confusing foolishness from @NYGovCuomo. The emails and texts have already gone out.  …
For NYC parents confused about whether school is cancelled, here's what happened: Around 9:30 AM: @BilldeBlasio says school is cancelled for rest of year. Around noon: @NYGovCuomo says, basically, that's just the Mayor's opinion, and its his call.  …
there are going to be flare up here and there, but the regular flu has flare ups as well. what's the difference? The country has been closed down long enough. Time to begin now to slowly reopen.

History repeats.

Here’s video of @NYGovCuomo reacting to @BilldeBlasio’s statement on school  …
Wow this is crazy. So much for Cuomo being the sensible one. There is simply no way schools can reopen. Kids tend to be asymptomatic superspreaders, so it’s just asking for another wave.
Normal is what got us here. We should do better and put people first already.
Be sure that your kids are first in line to crowd that classroom.
“There’s no politics in this,” Andrew Cuomo says, while clubbing Bill DeBlasio repeatedly with an oversized mallet.
This is ridiculous. NYC just emailed and texted residents telling them schools are closed. Districts don’t need to close together during snow days or weather emergencies. The Gov is causing parents and teachers to be confused and for me to disconnect from social media right now
Maybe this can explain why @NYGovCuomo has been on the television so much. But I know #Rudy is waiting in the background to see if this has any truth to it. @DNC would be a fool to add Cuomo, that might be going to worse than @JoeBiden #F4  …
"That is, on one hand, flattering. On the other hand, it is irrelevant." @NYGovCuomo says he is "not running for president" in the wake of polling saying he should replace Joe Biden as the 2020 Democratic nominee

Dissonance between @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo on schools closure doesn't appear likely to be resolved today. "It's not going to be decided in the next few days, because we don’t know," Cuomo says.
the virus makes the timeline...we set a goal to flatten the curve... we are just reaching the top of the curve and we kept that lower through social distancing.. now we flatten it by continuing the plan.. we need to tough it out
. @NYGovCuomo team says they do a daily call with hospitals and "no one has been turned away" for care.
Gov. Cuomo: “I’m not running for president. I'm not running for vice president. I'm not running anywhere. I'm not going to Washington. I'm staying right here."  
. @NYGovCuomo says easing of restrictions in NY “ideally” would be in concert with CT and NJ. “I’m not going to operate without coordinating with NJ and CT.”
Governor @NYGovCuomo is also now reiterating that he was the one who closed NYC Public Schools, not de Blasio, which means Cuomo also has to take the criticism for the long delay in doing so, most of which has been directed at @NYCMayor
Governor Cuomo Issues Guidance on Essential Services Under The 'New York State on PAUSE' Executive Order  via @nygovcuomo

If you were unaware of the long running tensions between the governor and New York City mayor, this is a window into their relationship as @NYGovCuomo says its his legal authority to decide school schedule after DeBlasio made a declaration Cuomo is calling an opinion.
This morning, Mayor de Blasio announced the decision to keep NYC schools closed for the remainder of the school year, but Gov. Cuomo now says there has been “no decision” on the schools: “That’s the mayor’s opinion”

You may recall that @NYGovCuomo issued an order on March 18 requiring state approval for any local ordinances.  …
. @NYGovCuomo responds to question that some Democrats want Cuomo to replace Biden "That is on one hand flattering on the other hand irrelevant"
And one way to make that "misstep" and guarantee we "go through this all over again" is to not only be unprepared for what Julio Vincent Gambuto calls "the ultimate gaslighting" but to let it happen 
@NYGovCuomo just told @NYCMayor to sit down and let the big boys make decisions , love it
. @NYGovCuomo says contrary to @NYCMayor's announcement earlier, NO DECISION has been made on whether and when to re-open schools. This is a significant move by Cuomo and will sow confusion. “That’s his position, but he didn’t close them and he can’t open them," he says.
I mean- what?? Just an hour ago we had announcement that NYC schools are not reopening. Now 
. @NYGovCuomo "There has been no decision" on the schools. Cuomo says he understands Mayor DeBlasio 's position announced today to keep schools closed through academic year but Cuomo says it will be a more coordinated decision beyond just the city.
NEW: @NYGovCuomo overrules @NYCMayor on school closures. Says Mayor cannot make a decision on closing New York City schools on his own. “It’s his opinion,” says Cuomo. “There has been no decision on schools.”
Now @NYGovCuomo saying @NYCMayor cannot make this call.  messaging is not good for the city and its  …
What's scary is Trump wanting to open the country,and everyone getting frustrated being told to stay home, will start supporting his rediculous idea to open . Trump is pouring gas on a wild fire
Mr Cuomo continue to guide lead NY this way! God bless u God bless NY. Good job
I am watching @NYGovCuomo speaking and I know we will get through this. He's not going to let trump bully his way into reopening anything until it's safe for New Yorkers.

Cuomo's entire appearance today is a live-action subtweet of Trump
“When and how we reopen is both a public health and economic question. We must avoid a second wave of infection.” @NYGovCuomo is breaking it down beautifully.  …
"The worst thing that can happen is we make a misstep and we let our emotions get ahead of logic and fact and we go through this again." @NYGovCuomo on weight of reopening decisions
The lockdown models predicted WAY more death, what happened?
BRAVO: Governor Cuomo calls out Trump and GOP for taking away most of SALT (State & Local taxes) from many states and cities that desperately NEED it. "If you want to REALLY help New York, repeal the tax law!" Especially after we eventually re-open the economy during #COVIDー19
He has to, or Trump will kill us all. I’ve never seen anyone work smarter to save the citizens of his state.
We believe we have hit the "apex" — and the apex is a plateau. We are not out of the woods. We are still seeing new hospitalizations and new infections. But it is stabilizing. Social distancing is working. We must keep it up.
From @NYGovCuomo briefing: NY appears to have reached the apex Hospitalizations have plateaued; 3-day average is on a downward slope ICU admissions are down over a 3 day span Intubations are down Spread to other counties appears to have stabilized
"If no one sounded the alarm in January and February, how do we know its safe to proceed now?" asks @NYGovCuomo "There's troubling signs on the horizon" concerned about next wave of illness
"Reopening is a public health question and an economic question. I am unwilling to divorce the two. " AMEN @NYGovCuomo. Amen.
New York has lost 8,627 citizens with deaths Friday reaching 783 according to @NYGovCuomo
"There is no economic answer that does not attend to public health," @NYGovCuomo
Cuomo scoffs at the notion that the United States can open its economy without the engine of the New York economy. "You're kidding yourself," the governor says.
Both Governor Cuomo and Hogan have been in contact with @SpeakerPelosi, look for her to get as much funding as possible, with the republicans actively working against her.
"You think you're going to open up the economy without the engine of the New York metropolitan area? You're kidding yourself." Exactly right from @NYGovCuomo.
For the welfare of the citizens of NY  understand why 
. @NYGovCuomo spending a lot of time today on uncertainty of modeling. “It's too soon for Monday quarterbacking because the game isn’t even over yet."
Is it me or is @NYGovCuomo doing some brown nosing to Drumpf?

New York curve continuing to flatten, in fact intubations in negative territory... BUT live lost “stabilizing at a horrific rate” at around 800 per day, @NYGovCuomo said. Adding: “We must stay the course” knowing there’s temptation to discuss re-opening society. 
"There's no doubt I have worked hand in glove with the president here..." @NYGovCuomo "He has really responded to New York's needs..." Cuomo says keep politics out of decision to reopen.

It's not just 2020 stuff. Democrats are really into Cuomo right now even though any cursory examination of what he did to prepare for  the pandemic shows that he got a lot of people killed. Meanwhile Inslee is doing a great job and nobody seems to notice or care.

Every time @NYGovCuomo says “The virus has been ahead of us” he admits he’s been reactive & not proactive in realizing the measures needed to save more lives. I have coronavirus. My manager. My mom. NY has more cases than whole nations & cops still out here body slamming ppl.

In NY, people right now are being sent to jail & prison for things like missing curfew, failing to check in with a parole officer, & forgetting to update an address. Always cruel. Always wasteful. Always irrational. Especially so right now. This is 100% on @NYGovCuomo.  …
MANY, many more are dying in NY State and City than the authorities and @NYGovCuomo are letting know. People are dying at home, on the streets, at hospitals before being tested. They are not part of the official count. They need to be counted. NOT RIGHT #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday announced that New York state had set a new single-day record of 779 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday. Since they're counting everything as Kung Flu, this is skewed!  …

It's laughable that Dems consider Andrew Cuomo presidential material. They need to pull their heads out of their asses. He has failed to lead, and 8000 dead New Yorkers back that up. The only thing he's qualified to do is replace the Grim Reaper if he ever decides to retire.
The Fed needs to force Cuomo / NYS to take the signs down, and everyone in Cuomo's administration must take a pay cut to reimburse NYS taxpayers for the cost of the signs.

Anyone want to make a wager? I bet @NYGovCuomo uses Covid-19 as the reason New York defaults on MSA bonds. I would also bet Cuomo asks the Feds or Big T to kick in $$$to avoid telling citizens how he mismanaged the MSA payouts. Any takers? Erin @NYSMom4Kiddos ?
I'm not mad at @NYGovCuomo the man because politics aren't easy, but as a Governer his decision to keep the subway open failed the people of New York and was CATASTROPHIC. I'm not here to bash him, he's got enough on his plate and will have to look in the mirror, rest of his life  …

He will have to look in the mirror everyday knowing he kept the Subway open @NYGovCuomo made the biggest mistake of his life.
He made a catastrophic mistake when @NYGovCuomo decided to keep NYC subways open. The damn #CoronaVirus lived on a Cruise Ship for 17 days, imagine how long it will live on those filthy subways.
Cuomo is a Whiner. Every time he is in front of the camera, he just whines. Trump is a DOER. When he is in front of the camera, he tells us what he and his team are doing. Cuomo and Trump are as different as night and day.

As you hear frothing excitement about Dom Daddy @NYGovCuomo as a potential leader, look even a TINY bit at what he is doing NOW: pushing to cut both #Medicaid AND aid to hospitals in the middle of this crisis. Long time foes of his corruption like @ZephyrTeachout shine a light
No... I do find it pretty off. But then, so is Trump saying he would date his daughter. And some of the pictures.. That's a weird relationship. Or of course, Trump walking in to teen Miss USA and ogling the contestants. And of course the rape of his wife. That's sick.
Elizabeth is a joke and a fake.

Which state did she win again? I can’t quite remember. She lost progressives two races in a row now. I’m rooting for and donating to her progressive primary challengers.
@NYGovCuomo would have to explaining n unexplainable things to voters like thousands of ventilators that sat in NJ storage,why he allowed Chinatown party during China virus and more.say no to #CuomoVirus
FYI, this whole story was started by a poll done by a Republican firm whose results were given exclusively to the NY Post, for the sole reason of getting Sanders supporters to tweet things like this. Just so you're aware.
That's exactly right. If there were one city and state on this planet that should have been ready for such a catastrophic health emergency....it should have been New York. Yet Cuomo gets only praise while the President gets all the blame.
. @NYGovCuomo slashed Medicare and Medicaid in the midst of this pandemic Wow And now he and the  are talking about canceling our primary and knocking Bernie off the ballot #NoCuomo
Yeah that same leader who when he could get more ventilators he passed on
Will be VOTING PRESIDENT TRUMP 2020
I don't know a single person who has seriously suggested any such thing, and Cuomo has openly said he has no interest in running.

If that happens then the people must protest so that the next actual candidate in line, Bernie Sanders, gets the rightful nomination. If Biden isn’t up to it, then Bernie absolutely deserves it, not Cuomo or anyone else.

Reopening NYS will be a gradual process and it  down to testing. We developed an antibody test but we need the Federal Government to help. They must use the Defense Production Act to rapidly scale up testing. If I could – I would.
The 1918 flu epidemic lasted 10 months, and the second wave was worse than the first, says @NYGovCuomo. He wants the nation to be more prepared, study the waters and proceed with caution.
. @NYGovCuomo is awesome. Serious, candid, confident leadership.
. @NYGovCuomo talking about 1918 flu epidemic and its three peaks. He's warning  and a second wave.
TAKE ACTION: I am calling on @NYGovCuomo and @GavinNewsom to grant #ClemencyNow to elders and others vulnerable to #COVID19. We will not stop demanding #ClemencyCoast2Coast until our loved ones are home and safe. #LetThemGo @RAPPcampaign @CURBprisons @c_c_w_p 
Gov Cuomo, Believe it or not. You sir are doing a fantastic job. Just think. How much better YOU would be doing if the federal government had their act together!!! God bless you and your family. I live in Illinois. Thank you and God bless your work!
We’re all waiting for you to be a hero @NYGovCuomo and provide assistance by granting clemencies to people locked up in your prisons who are most vulnerable to #COVID19 #ClemencyNow #LetThemGo  …
This goes out to all you DirtyLibs & Rino’s that are globalist . @govmurphy . @nygovcuomo You won’t be in Power Long!

This is the BS that causes harm. We know what happened. We have a Mayor who moved 2 slowly if at all We have @NYGovCuomo who asked for & received unprecedented powers & also refused bold action except 4 cutting medicaid There's a price for #COVID19 inaction, it's now  …
This is obvious and for Trump to not understand it shows how  he is.
Cuomo says prior to reopening businesses in NY state, NY needs the federal govt to assist with production of COVID tests at scale.  alone not enough. @NYGovCuomo: “If I had a Defense Production Act [at the state level], I would use it. #PressConference #COVID19
Saying thanks is nice. Providing assistance is better. I’m working with NY's Congressional delegation to create a "COVID-19 Heroes Compensation Fund" to support frontline workers and their families. Just as Congress did after 9/11, we need to support our heroes once again.
A day after Pres Trump said national testing system is not needed to re-open, @NYGovCuomo says testing will be "key" to that. He says: "It's going to be reliant on testing, testing of antibodies, testing for diagnostic results. Testing on a scale that we have not done before."
At daily briefing @NYGovCuomo focuses on testing as the “key to reopening” the economy. Calls on federal government to use Defense Production Act to mass produce testing equipment and reagents. 
. @NYGovCuomo — State lab can do 300 antibody tests per day. In two weeks they’ll be up to 2,000 per day. But he admits it’s “a drop in the bucket” and not nearly enough. #coronavirus 
Me watching Gov Coco giving a news brief. @NYGovCuomo 
Since the outbreak of #COVID19, @GavinNewsom has granted only 21 clemencies and @NYGovCuomo has granted ZERO.  clemencies for two states with 166K people in prison isn’t enough. We need bold, sweeping action NOW to prevent more COVID-19 deaths. 
NEW: NYS Department of Health is ramping up antibody tests. -300 tests a day capacity right now -1000 tests by next Friday -2000 tests the following week “Thats great that sounds like a lot but that’s a drop in the bucket," @NYGovCuomo says.
. @NYGovCuomo Coronavirus News Briefing - LIVE online here:  
A real NYer too.
Almost 3000 people were murdered by being choked to death, burned to death or crushed to death for all the world to see, all within a few hours, in one day. Please stop belittling  9/11 to anything @NYGovCuomo. K. Thx.
Shhh... a real leader @NYGovCuomo is talking.
No one should go hungry because of this pandemic. NYS will provide $200 million in emergency food assistance to more than 700K  households enrolled in SNAP. Food is a very real issue for many families.
The effort to close Indian Point nuclear plant is, literally, corrupt It included bribery by a natural  of top aides to @NYGovCuomo 
NEW: @NYGovCuomo calling for  fund" for #COVID19 front line workers.
@NYGovCuomo THANK YOU for your calm , humanity and leadership
Indian Point is 23% of New York’s emissions-free electricity @NYGovCuomo is shutting it down because “environmentalists” including @AOC @NRDC @SierraClub @EnvDefenseFund want him to They promote renewables to greenwash their pro-pollution 
We continue to endure great pain as we lost 777 New Yorkers yesterday. We feel this loss deeply as a  and New York family. It is a terrible, heartbreaking loss.
NEW: 777 more people have been reported dead as a result of COVID-19 pandemic in New York State, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says. The state’s death total is now 7,844. He says there’s been a dramatic decline in hospitalization growth rates. There were 17 FEWER people in ICUs yesterday
. @NYGovCuomo says actual curve is "much" lower than projected He cites policies put in place,  from public
NEW: "The actual curve is much much lower than any of them projected," @NYGovCuomo. Actual hospitalizations stand 18,569; some projections had up to 136,000 beds needed.
NEW: @NYGovCuomo announces ICU admissions are in the *negative* today for the first time. Three day average of total hospitalizations is also down; same with intubations. However, 777 people have died since yesterday. Total deaths: 7,844. Very sad. #coronavirus 
New York state has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, so why hasn't @NYGovCuomo stopped water shutoffs? Everyone needs access to water to wash their hands and stop the spread of the virus. 
Excuse me, @NYGovCuomo my Daughter’s friend’s Grandma died yesterday NOT from Coronavirus but she is listed as dying from CoronavirusWhat’s that about???
We are cautiously optimistic that we are slowing the spread. The change in daily ICU admissions was a negative number for the first time (-17). That means there were fewer people in ICU units statewide yesterday than there were on the previous day.
Wow - big: @NYGovCuomo announces first day of net drop in ICU admissions since the coronavirus crisis became acute.
BREAKING: @NYGovCuomo says ICU admissions in New York are “a negative number for the first time”. Meaning instead of the rate of increase slowing, Coronavirus admissions are actually dropping.  …
Wow. ICU admissions today in NY is a negative number for the first time, says @NYGovCuomo
Thank you @NYGovCuomo for being the leader NY needs in the absence of a functional @realDonaldTrump

Way past time 4 @NYGovCuomo 2 release incarcerated elders & others vulnerable to coronavirus. What kind of person refuses to pick up a pen to save lives?? #ClemencyNow #ClemencyCoast2Coast Base release decisions on public health, not criminal Injustice. @RAPPcampaign 
NY Gov. Cuomo says President Trump should use the Defense Production Act to streamline coronavirus testing. "Leaving it to the states is a slower, less uniform, less affective process." 
Not only that, Cuomo was the first major endorsement Biden received! This is crap
Outside of clemencies @NYGovCuomo & @GavinNewsom have used their power to only release people convicted of “non-violent”, low-level offenses and others for parole violations. These releases are good but not enough. #ClemencyCoast2Coast must include everyone vulnerable to 
Since the outbreak of #COVID19, @NYGovCuomo still has granted ZERO clemencies. With over 43,000 people incarcerated in New York State prisons, we need bold, sweeping action NOW to prevent more COVID-19 deaths. #ClemencyCoast2Coast 
I’m starting to appreciate things much more, like a hot shower, a steaming cup of coffee, a late night chat with my teen, and @NYGovCuomo. But, I sure wish we had a President to lead us through this pandemic, like @BarackObama or @HillaryClinton. #TrumpIsALoser #TrumpVirus
. @NYGovCuomo is set to deliver his #Coronavirus news briefing at 11:30AM. Here are the updates: NY's prison system has more COVID19 cases than any other state prison system in the entire country. Yet @NYGovCuomo has granted ZERO clemencies. We hope Capitol press will ask him why. 
@NYGovCuomo endorsed @JoeBiden and spoke warmly of him in pressers. I won’t give this oxygen
So, what is the deal with HART ISLAND in NYC? Supposedly 25 bodies are buried there any given week but now it's almost daily. I want to hear @NYGovCuomo talk about this in his one of his lengthy updates! 
Would be great if someone asked @NYGovCuomo why he won't stop water shutoffs in the midst of the pandemic. Pretty hard to wash your hands without running water. @jessemckinley @m_jfrench 
Be skeptical. Be safe. Stand up for your freedom. As we told you then, Gov. Cuomo was wrong when he said: “What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California, and Washington state, and Illinois. It's just a matter of time.” #ReopenAmerica

What's "selfish" about asking for basic democracy? You do realize what this does to silence half of the country if Biden were to step down at the convention due to "ill health"? By blocking Bernie's right to votes & delegates, that enables the DNC to coronate whoever they want.
The "Joe Biden for Andrew Cuomo" poll that's trending  by the conservative Club for Growth, which surely has no incentives to sow discord in the Dem Primary and a perfect record for producing unbiased and accurate polling of primaries/elections.

@NYGovCuomo and @GavinNewsom have used their power to only release people convicted of “non-violent”, low-level offenses and others held on parole violations. These releases are good but not enough. #ClemencyCoast2Coast must include everyone vulnerable to

Oh absolutely and I will do my best to help others break that law Sent my resume in to the cartel Ready to underground pipeline the liquid
True, but any #vapeban law I will deliberately break!! I am not going back to smoking.
I think the ventilators causing 80% mortality on IC's could be one of the reasons. But also if someone who was a little ill and has a car crash and dies is another CV  …
Technically if you have driven 1 mph over a posted speed limit you have broken a law Just saying and there are some laws so crazy people break them without ever knowing they were actual laws

Yeah right while NYC leadership was calling Trump a Racist and not taking this virus seriously they encouraged thousands to flood the streets and 2 weeks later they went on 
@NYGovCuomo Why Would You Move Patients From One Hospital To Another? Are Those Pacemaker & Defibrillator Patients You Are Keeping Away From 5 G Your Installing In & Around Those Facilities? What Other Hospitals Are Also Doing It ? Shocker #Q #Qanon #WWG1WGA #FilmYourHospital
The same Cuomo that was asking for more ventilators while he had a warehouse full of them?
TAKE ACTION: Use the link below to email & tweet your elected officials and @NYGovCuomo — tell them it’s time to pass #LessIsMoreNY NOW and #EndtheCycle of incarceration for crimeless violations of parole. People inside can’t wait, 
The Longer Trump is “Leading” the Response to COVID-19, the MORE Americans will DIE. Direct Correlation 16,979 Americans are DEAD Wish @NYGovCuomo could lead the National Response Team. Lives would be SAVED.
One of my ancestors died in your state trying to outrun a pandemic. Died anyway. Infected others. I have scores of relatives who died thinking the pandemic was over. It wasn't. Get back to normal? Me? Nah. I'm in the South, but I'm listening to the voices of the NY dead.
Love my 
@NYGovCuomo you asked for information about the underlined reasons on why POC are more affected than their white counterparts. Socioeconomic, they have more stressful lives, work longer hours or may need to work 2-3 jobs to get their ends met, may have  1/n
Make sure your Governor is like @GavinNewsom @NYGovCuomo @JayInslee etc. Make sure they listen to #HealthcareHeroes, not self-serving liars like  …
Hearing of @GavinNewsom loaning ventilators to @NYGovCuomo made me long for a president that we can trust again. This exchange will work because these two leaders trust one another.
The first two people to die on Rikers were among thousands currently incarcerated in NY for technical parole violations like curfew, failure to update a mailing address, hanging out w/ someone previously incarcerated. Cuomo could release them all if he wanted to.
And they want Cuomo to be President. 
Thank you to healthcare and transportation workers and ALL our essential personnel on the frontlines @NYGovCuomo #NYTough  …

As a New Yorker,can someone tell me why New York death rates and possibly infection rates were much higher than anywhere else? @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor didn’t enforce or shut down large groups in the city or on the subway platforms in the Bronx. Our playgrounds & courts busy too.
New York set another horrible record setting day for most daily deaths from #COVID19 of 799 on April 8. Some good news is new cases are truly declining - social distancing is flattening the curve in NY but bad days still ahead says @NYGovCuomo at excellent briefing 
Healthcare workers: we need masks, gloves and equipment urgently! Dems: here are some blue lights
Jon’s right. We all need to reframe the way we discuss Trump’s actions. I feel lucky to be in NY were I don’t believe our Governor @NYGovCuomo would send us back to work too early, given what we are going through now. Why create a setback? Trump is a disgrace.  …

The people pausing to pay respect before burying the dead are the same people who @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo have condemned to death at Rikers.  …
My cousin is a nurse manager at NY Presbyterian/Cornell hospital on NYC's Upper East Side. While I worry about her (she is exhausted) I am so very proud of her, her colleagues & every health care worker from docs to janitors + first responders & funeral directors. Epic effort.

Tell that to Trump 
Imagine if it weren’t raining this morning? How many people would be out getting exercise, like the @NYGovCuomo who has recently taken up jogging? Perhaps the governor can help here. Will someone open the streets to protect pedestrians? 
@NYGovCuomo as gov IS responsible for NYS Emergency Mgmt Plan - planning & execution - which includes managing all hospital resources across the state & managing surge capacity. Each state must submit plans to FEMA & many were dinged for being inadequate in their pandemic plans.
The DEATH count I’m interested in… Is how many people needlessly died… Because leftist denied Hydroxy cocktail simply b/c Pres @realDonaldTrump  it! My guess- 40% of the deaths in NY could’ve been saved if NY Gov Cuomo didn’t issue an Exec Order denying treatment!
I am calling on @NYGovCuomo & @GavinNewsom to grant #ClemencyNow & other releases to elders & others vulnerable to #COVID19. This is a public health crisis & human rights violation. It is beyond time to #LetThemGo! The situation in our prisons is DIRE! 
@NYGovCuomo & @GavinNewsom, this is Brandy Scott. Brandy is a Black trans survivor who was locked up for protecting herself from an abusive partner. Like MANY survivors behind bars, Brandy has been waiting for clemency-for justice since before #COVID19. Please grant

Dallas lights it 
@NYGovCuomo pleaded with the FDA to let him run his own testing. By March 2nd NY discovered it's first case of local corona virus transmission. Within days cases popped up everywhere. No amount of detectives were enough to follow up on the sheer number of new cases.
Before Feb. 27th it was illegal to test anyone who had not visited Wuhan China for Corona Virus. CDC would not allow NYState to run their own tests or to expand the testing criteria. All along New York was blind about any local contagion what-so-ever.
NY's first case arrived at JFK on March 1st whilst the WH, CDC and WHO were telling our Mayor and Governor that Americans should not worry about possible spread...that the threat to us way very low. By March 7th @NYGovCuomo called for State of Emergency.
Great news. New Hampshire & New York were two out of the 'Trailing Ten' states that still aren't allowing Vote at Home, despite the pandemic. @NYGovCuomo recently announced NY would move to absentee voting for the June primary - now New Hampshire will allow it too. 8 to go!  …

These are issues many governors are also grappling with. It isn’t novel to the a White House. Cuomo, like some WH aides, has talked about how the models have been imprecise. But testing is still not where it needs to be and there are concerns about cases spiking again.  …

Another day, NY and NJ accounted for more than half of all US deaths from COVID-19, and lord only knows how many actually died FROM COVID-19. Meanwhile, CA, a state with twice the population of NY accounted for only 2% of US deaths. Tell me Cuomo isn't jacking his numbers?

Good for @CNN . Between @chrisCuomo and his awesome brother @NYGovCuomo banter during dark times, and this decision I might revisit now that they have fewer Trumplican psychos on air. Just get rid of that @RickSantorum
I was watching this just to enjoy some brotherly banter, but I have to point out an inaccuracy in something @NYGovCuomo said while talking to @ChrisCuomo - New York was NOT ahead of other states in taking action and closing schools. OHIO was the first. 
A little something I made for my favorite brothers <3 @ChrisCuomo @NYGovCuomo 
One of the reasons why black and latino nyers are disproportionately affected by the covid19 crisis is because of @NYGovCuomo racist policies

Why would anyone watch “Keeping up with the Kardashians” when you can keep up with the Cuomos? Best TV siblings @NYGovCuomo 
Younger people aren't immune to catching or spreading the virus. It doesn't care how old you are or what you want. It's called sacrifice for a reason. The older generation fought & sacrificed for us all. Staying home saves lives, yours, mine & theirs & helps healthcare workers.

Last Friday when asked if New York had enough ventilators as the state was expected to see a surge, and after the federal government sent zero of the 17,000 requested by Cuomo, Trump responded we’ll “find out.” That should have been the end of his presidency.
I missed you sounding the alarm in January. I did however catch the outrage at the travel ban issued by you, @SenSchumer, @SpeakerPelosi, @BilldeBlasio, @NYGovCuomo. Hard to believe you saw any sign when you couldn't even see the importance of that one move.  …
