Yes, we've reached that tipping point. Mulgrew called on @NYCMayor to close the schools -- They met in person earlier today. The Mayor is not budging. @UFT members by the thousands are speaking out on this. @NYCSchools are a mess. Let's hope @NYCMayorsOffice starts listening.

As Chair of @NYCCouncil #SmallBusinessCommittee I am proud to be joined by NYC Business Leaders and groups as I call on the @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor to delay payment of business taxes as  sector struggles with the impact of coronavirus

Gotta give props to @NYGovCuomo. He obviously sees that testing is the key here-you can’t fight what you can’t see. 35k in 2 week! This is a monumental challenge but we’re New Yorkers, dammit, we can do it. #CallToActionNYC
It’s Friday, 5pm and the only measure @NYGovCuomo has taken this week for incarcerated NYers in the wake of COVID-19 is forcing them to produce hand sanitizer for the rest of us. Calls for him to #FreeOurElders & grant #ClemencyNow are growing. Will he act before it’s too late?

Today along with @RAPPcampaign @NYCAIC @paroleprepny @WorthRises we sent a letter to @NYGovCuomo with demands related to rights and conditions for incarcerated people in New York State. 
It took untill today for the @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump administration to concede that they blew the testing. We should move on, but that fact is now established by his own admission. If @FoxNews publishes a false propaganda reality, @NYGovCuomo should shut them down in NYC.
First Governor of California and now Governor of New York, showing gratitude to President Trump for his efforts with the coronavirus crisis. Is this what it took to begin unifying all Americans? I'm not holding my breath for a miracle, but this small step is worth noting.
Federal civil rights champion @AyannaPressley calls out disastrous response by @NYGovCuomo regarding incarcerated people during the #COVID19 crisis. Points out he’s exploiting prison labor to make soap they aren’t allowed to use in jails and calls for clemencies to release ppl.
Maryland just closed schools and immediately announced that they would continue feeding school children using schools as base, as @chefjoseandres suggests. Just ask @GovLarryHogan how he is doing it, @andrewcuomo

New York went from 212 cases Wednesday to almost double, 421 today - the most in the country. What has changed is Gov. Cuomo is aggressively seeking out testing from private labs. As Pelosi says, it's all about testing, testing, testing. That is how we contain and save lives.

Here’s a thought @NYGovCuomo @melissadderosa @NYCMayor I came across some Queens & Bronx workers who asked to get #COVID19 updates via texts like we do for missing children & extreme weather--because they don't have access to the daily news conferences while on the job.
This is really critical reading for school leaders and policy makers...IMO it supports @NYGovCuomo resistance to statewide mandated short and medium term closures as the impact  spread is not scientifically proven  …
A 1 week moratorium isn't enough. But it's a sign the pressure is working. @NYCMayor should immediately order city marshals to halt all evictions in NYC to build pressure on @NYGovCuomo for an indefinite statewide moratorium. No profits for landlords who expose us to disease.  …
I am a fan of the way Washington State Governor @JayInslee handled the Coronavirus outbreak. He acted early & decisive including closing schools. @NYGovCuomo always the shrewd political operative leaves that tough call to “local” authorities.

We know that some New Yorkers are going to lose work & even their jobs because of #Coronavirus. NYS will immediately waive the 7-day waiting period for unemployment insurance for people who have been laid off due to virus.

Despite six other states closing schools, @NYGovCuomo resists doing the same, says its a much  issue in #NY, as many kids rely on schools for meals. "It's don't that simple," he said.
Watching my Governor, @NYGovCuomo plead on tv for the federal government to allow labs in our state to test for #coronavirus. How sick is this? How sick will our country get with Trump’s uncaring ineptitude? Cuomo says we could be doing SO MUCH MORE if Pence would let him. FFS
Good grief! Did @NYGovCuomo just say “they needed to be liberated from the federal government to do testing?” These are the same people that want to turn our entire healthcare system over to the govt. Are they finally recognizing the Feds shouldn’t be involved in healthcare?

Thanks to wonderful @ProfLWiley more nuance on @NYGovCuomo's unfortunate use of "containment" in New Rochelle. It's more like social distancing: ban on gatherings, school closure, deep cleaning, & mobile food delivery. Use of Nat'l Guard to buttress #COVIDー19 response warranted

Mr. President! @realDonaldTrump Please stand up to your crooked enemy @NYGovCuomo and his relentless attacks on life-saving vapor products! Now his lying administration is saying vaping causes #COVID19? *BONUS: Pro-vaping  with 15 millionish votes #wevapewevote
Petitioning exacerbates an existing health crisis, and so many are already at risk. @RepJerryNadler, the gov @NYGovCuomo may not listen to a bunch of challengers, but he’d listen to you. I hope you’ll publicly sign on to protecting the health of NYers over protecting incumbents.  …
I can't believe in 2020 we still have people who support the murder of babies. @NYGovCuomo allowed for late term abortion, how is that not murder. #CelebrateAbortionProviders is the craziest hashtag I have ever seen.

 of NY state and of NYC is scary. Only known successful way to stop coronavirus is China's and South Korea. The first is not acceptable in a democratic state but the second is. NY is instead going the way of Iran, Italy, France ... @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor
Dear @NYGovCuomo, Many of us are literally putting ourselves at risk of catching the corona virus because of petioning. Can you waive petioning and allow all candidates to get on the ballot?
Not a huge @NYGovCuomo fan. But listening to him on @cnn right now, and think, "Man, it's nice hearing people who speak off of information."
Dear @NYGovCuomo, it really looks like NY is doing the same mistake Lombardy did, in Italy. Containment in New Rochelle now is most probably useless (too little too late), as containment in Codogno (a small town close to Milan where it all looked like it started) was!!
In a time of public health crisis, @NYGovCuomo is exploiting prison labor rather than protecting the most vulnerable. We need you tomorrow outside City Hall at 12pm to call on Gov. Cuomo to release the oldest, sickest, & other incarcerated New Yorkers most vulnerable to COVID-19.

Trump worked hard on his golf game over the weekend. So there's that.
No. I do, though, spend time considering what this state would be like if @marcmolinaro were Governor. In that timeline, New York would be worthy of being known as the Empire State. With @NYGovCuomo, we are the Empire State of Andrew M. Cuomo — #1 in all the worst categories.  …

We see @NYGovCuomo using the labor of Black, brown, and poor folks in prison to make 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer a week. Paying less than $1/hr, some as little as .16 cents/hr. We call it slave labor. And it’s got to stop.  …

Using slave labor to make a buck. Democrat or Republican are almost the same.
you might've skipped a few options between "leave them in their cage" and "make them work for 0.65/h while also charging them money"
JOINT STATEMENT in response to @NYGovCuomo announcing that New Yorkers in prison will produce hand sanitizer  Coronavirus outbreak. We join @RAPPcampaign @citizenactionny @VOCALNewYork & @paroleprepny to demand clemency, rights for incarcerated workers & broader 
Making sure the people running infrastructure and required to touch surfaces in public transport have access to the means to control infection IS in the taxpayer’s prime interest. Hopefully they can do more, but this is a great step.
Last week @NYGovCuomo said manufacturers put vitamin E acetate into nicotine liquids. That's physically impossible. One is an oil, the other aqueous. NY Mayor @BilldeBlasio now tells us vapers are at higher risk of Coronavirus... Based on zero evidence.   …
What @NYGovCuomo doesn't mention while he's cracking jokes: The hand sanitizer is "made, conveniently" by incarcerated people being forced to work for 65 cents/hour. If you want to improve public health, pay people behind bars a real wage. #laborislabor  …
prison labor is slave labor. how can anybody think its fine for NY prisoners to work for an average of less than $2 an hour all the while having rights stripped from them every day. What is being done to protect the inmates?
Members of @NYGovCuomo's admin, including @NYSERDA's @abartontweets and DEC R5 Director Bob Stegemann, held a roundtable discussion today on the proposed $3 Billion #RestoreMotherNature Environmental Bond Act with Adirondack area environmental groups and 
His line of soaps, candles and  out next month.
At least minimum wage, obviously. If prison labor is cheaper then it creates a financial incentive to have more prisoners.
Every word rings true in one writer's account of the slow-motion medical chaos in NYC around testing for the Coronavirus. @robinshulman @NYGovCuomo  …
It would be amazing if they were giving inmates the experience and certifications to work with chemicals to make cleaning supplies... However we all know that they would still be prevented from being hired due having to self-identify as a felon & the stigma attached to that
Made by prison labor.

but since you're so much smarter than us, why dont tell us why it isn't slave labor. seriously.
NY State @NYGovCuomo just held a presser in which he addressed price-gouging of hand sanitizer in NYState. The State is now officially making its own with 75% alcohol & scented for a fraction of the price of "Purell". 5 gallons, 7 oz & 4 oz(84cts). Solves at least 1 problem
So @NYGovCuomo will use prison labor for sanitizer that incarcerated ppl won't be able to use, while not paying them, keeping them in conditions where virus will likely run rampant, w/o real healthcare, while he tries to rollback #bailreform so more ppl are forced into  …
43 states charge inmates for their incarceration. new york is one of the 43.
Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton “is going to be on quarantine." @NYGovCuomo indicated that Cotton could have  infected while he was visiting local airports.

Gov. Cuomo describing how much hand sanitizer the state of New York has produced so far 
Inmates at Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Washington County — a max security prison — are producing state issued hand sanitizer. @NYGovCuomo says it costs $6 per gallon & state has capacity to produce 100k gallons a week. It’ll be given out to municipalities, schools etc 
Let's get this straight... @NYGovCuomo is using slave labor of incarcerated folks to produce hand sanitizer for the schools that we can't close because we have too many homeless children who need shelter and food. Got it. This is dystopian af. We must do and be better than this.  …
This is what a real leader does @realDonaldTrump Take a lesson from @NYGovCuomo  …
Many of them wouldn’t be in prison in the first place if it wasn’t so profitable to lock people up for victimless, non violent crimes, in large part due to the continuation of slavery in prisons permitted by the 13th amendment. The entire system is rotten.
NY State will use prison labor to make hand sanitizer--while it denies basic hygienic protections to those same prisoners. People in power should be judged by how they treat the most vulnerable. By this metric @NYGovCuomo must be judged poorly. 
it would be cool if @NYGovCuomo would exercise his pardon power to free incarcerated people (like Iran is doing) instead of forcing them to manufacture hand sanitizer for those of us who aren't incarcerated.  …
Prison labour is slavery. The way he's bragging about this is disgusting.
Hand sanitizer is considered contraband in prisons in case you don't know. Inmates will be working for $0.65 per hour producing hand sanitizers for you while on top of the low pay, being treated as subhumans. If the inmate has fines or restitution, they will take $25 quarterly.
#COVID19 update from @NYGovCuomo – if a student tests positive, the state will close that student’s school at minimum for a 24-hour period to do an assessment.
It’s not. Time and time again, the government has proven that the life of the incarnated individuals out weigh that of the public. Slavery hasn’t end, it’s just been ‘reformed’

Prisoner labor being used to make emergency hand sanitizer that isn’t then used by them is... not good.

Is it... being used in the prison also? Prisoners need it.

So in other words, we are waiting for Coronavirus to arrive, THEN taking action. This isn’t a solid pandemic preparation plan.
Slim to none and Slim just left town
65 cents an hour
These new numbers "puts New York ahead of Washington," @NYGovCuomo says. Cuomo continues to urge calm and says hysteria is unwarranted. Only 8 of the 142 are hospitalized. The others are at home.
This is how we’re going to respond to every crisis now. With slavery. Both parties are the pro-slavery parties.
Can I just say how much I’m loving @NYGovCuomo right now? He’s so clear and level headed about this! He is miles above trump!!
BREAKING: Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority, has tested positive for the coronavirus and will be working from home, @NYGovCuomo announced.

Seriously what are the chances that so many people with some notoriety are getting infected without vast swaths of the general public not doing the same?

The sweet protection offered by  prison labor
Gov. Cuomo announced today that New York State is producing hand sanitizer. The governor says it is cheaper to make ourselves than purchase it. He says they will give it to schools, jails, government agencies, etc. If price gouging continues, Cuomo says they will start selling it

State officials like @NYGovCuomo: please don't wait for federal permission to allow private labs to do testing. Give them blanket permission to do so now. If the feds want to argue about it, fight it out in court in three years, not now. This is a time to be bold.

Both @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo ask NY’ers to avoid crowded subways and buses.  tells me that’s “ridiculous”. @wcbs880 
He knew about illicit THC & killer additive Vitamin E Acetate in Aug via DOH reports. He subpoenaed 3 additive makers 9/9/19  … Like CDC, spent 6 months blaming nicotine vaping for deaths/injuries to get bans. Zero to warn users. 1/16/20 CDC truthful, 
Don't get people's hopes up though, as I seriously doubt we have close to enough ECMO facilities/machines in the US for high loads. As of 2018, there were 236 US facilities that offered it, and not all are for adults, or have multiple machines. China had 60+ in one 
Oh well isn’t that nice, NOW they’re worried?! Ok so they take their test kits home with their GOLD health insurance get paid while home and the American people fend for themselves?! They don’t do shit anyway so I’ll just rely on my state as usual, @NYGovCuomo has us covered
cuomo is mandating that all insurers in NY provide the coronavirus test for free. but what happens if you actually _get_ coronavirus? you're still on the hook for all the costs with your $5,000 deductible. This is how diseases spread.
Then explain why labs in NY stand ready to perform automated testing and feds STILL haven’t approved You’re the president. Could make it happen in an instant Every hour we delay, lives are lost Feds need to stop blocking @NYGovCuomo who is trying to do the right thing!  …

Pls close the school.
While this approval is a good first step, the FDA must increase the #Coronavirus testing capacity for the State & private labs. Approving automated testing would allow labs to perform thousands of tests per day. The more tests we run, the better we can contain this virus.

Seeing a gang of teenaged thugs brutally attack a young girl in NY brings home the fact of what politicians like DiBlasio and Cuomo have done to the Empire State-not backing police and instituting the insane new no bail program Disrespect for the law is the beginning of anarchy
I also thought there would be relaxation of the CDC restrictions, so  labs would be authorized to run the tests. We have many excellent academic medical centers in NY who can step up to the plate.
And why do we need an authorization from the @CDCgov again? Just start the damn testing.

Some New Yorkers have jobs w sick benefits &not everyone has this. EMPLOYERS & COMPANIES should be placed under some type of penalty if they do not allow / fire their workers for calling out sick not all NY’ers have a number to call to file  or ask for help
if u really care about the health and safety of students and staff, close schools for a while to at least contain exposure and catch up on testing

@NYGovCuomo Cuomo needs to stop staying this. He sounds mighty stupid when whole cities and regions are going into quarantine. The fear is not irrational. The panic response is very real because the situation is beyond frightening.
We've been over this. There's a 100% chance I make at least 3x what you do. You're not good at this.
real great containment going on, andrew ...
What stupid thing to say.
Even in a deadly crisis, @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo can't get their shit together. They both put out press advisories within an hour of each other just now and both have a different numbers for NYC #coronavirusnewyork cases. Cuomo says 11, Blaz says 12.
