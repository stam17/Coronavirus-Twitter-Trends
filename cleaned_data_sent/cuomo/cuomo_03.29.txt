You know he did! In 24 hours he was well!
Jeez I hope they work. Never thought a governor would  China for donations to fight a virus they caused.
He won't allow it to be prescribed in a doctor's office. People have to go to a hospital so they can spread it around. That's what @NYGovCuomo wants. He needs to be able to spread the gloom and doom every single day on tv!!
I am incredibly proud of my home state for this action to send ventilators to @NYGovCuomo and the people of NY. Well done, @OregonGovBrown! We’re all in this together and we’ve got to coordinate and anticipate the needs of others. Help can’t wait. #COVIDー19 cc:  …
. @NYGovCuomo accepts 1,000 ventilators from China as New York battles the coronavirus. “This is a big deal, and it’s going to make a significant difference for us,” said Cuomo, revealing that Oregon would also be making donations. 
The loving relationship between the Cuomo brothers puts a human face on the crisis, something Trump isn't able to do - he doesn't register suffering  The media, which Trump hates, is showing us the monumental efforts of incredibly brave healthcare professionals
I'm incredulous that China has unleashed the mechanism for mass murder upon the entire world & nobody is talkin about war, reparations or debt forfeiture! @POTUS #collapse What's worse, the @NYGovCuomo is takin items from em likely contaminated UN vultures await
You should thank them for the virus.....and of course the ventilators they’ve sold you to fight their virus.....good business people the Chinese, they make long term plans, they’re smart, very smart.
In Colorado’s case, our governor is the one who went public about it. But sure, man.  …
This is not right. Cause of death should not be skewed toward COVID19 unless a test has been done. The seasonal flu can have similar symptoms. Makes you wonder how many of the global deaths attributed to COVID19 are not true.

No its not
Cuomo ordered pink light bulbs to celebrate abortion, but forgot to order the ventilators.
In 2015 governor Coumo decided not to invest in more ventilators for his state. States are supposed to be in control of their hospitals . The federal government is there to assist.
The Chinese government that melissa is saying can't be trusted trump thanked for transparency and their hard work for containing the virus. That's contrary to the narrative that they can't be trusted according to trump whom she constantly agrees with, and yes that is praise.

Trump says the ventilators that Cuomo announced today came from friends of Trump.
And that’s what he meant by keeping the federal stockpile for ourselves. He’s going to hang on to stuff until the red states get infected then swoop in like a savior with everything they need hoping to keep their votes.
Cuomo where’s 4000 ventilators you had in NJ? President Trump sent you 1000 more today, did you say thank you? He sent you a ship, built hospitals & sent you tons of masks. He sent 1000 members of the Military but your ungrateful ass never said thanks to him. #Coronavirus

Does anyone else feel like we are watching in real time Governor Cuomo is schooling Trump on how to do his job and then Trump stands at the podium and takes all the credit. He doesn’t know what the fuck he’s doing and I’m at least grateful Cuomo’s there & schooling him
Cuomo closed 16 unprofitable hospitals in NY the past 10 years AND eliminated 20,000 beds. (Healthcare workers provided these facts.) Plus, he chose not to buy thousands of ventilators in 2015 in favor of solar panel plants. He was woefully unprepared for this crisis!
The new normal as #Brooklyn Bus Operators power through their day @NYCTBus @MTA @NYGovCuomo @AFLCIO @CentralLaborNYC — soon to get 
Maybe he should step aside and let @NYGovCuomo take the lead in this battle.
He just referenced it, in fact.
What's stopping NYC universities from starting up labs like this @czbiohub lab at USCF? Money? @gatesfoundation @ChanZuckerberg Space? @Harlembiospace Regulations? @NYGovCuomo I know so many NYC scientists who would love to help get people the tests they need.  …
That @NYGovCuomo said weeks ago!!
100% right Melissa. This guy us shameful.
How 
. @realDonaldTrump now lashing out at governors (presumably @NYGovCuomo)  about levels of federal assistance, falsely claims that only Democratic governors are displeased with his administration's response to Covid19.
Does Trump not know that @OregonGovBrown sent ventilators to @NYGovCuomo ?
What if this was 
And the ventilators probably won’t work
It‘s a tremendous firehose. The best firehose. It‘s a beautiful firehose. Let me say this: I have seen many firehoses in my life. I have been in firehose more often than anyone else in the world. Some people ask: How can he know so much about firehose. Firhoses are best for fire

Really need to know the details of this Executive Order Will this be involuntary deployment? Will deployment be a condition for graduation? Huge power differentials exist within medical training.. I hope our youngest will not be coerced to the frontlines without adequate PPE.
This is truly a disgrace. 3 BOE employees have already died due to #COVID19, candidates are sick and the machine is still playing politics. Shout out to @BKYoungDems for leading the charge. #ShutItdown @NYGovCuomo  …

Hey @NYGovCuomo Did ya Thank #China For all your dead citizens too.
We NY. Our hearts beat with every NY'er and essential worker across America. Your heart beats with all of us, @NYGovCuomo, thank you. 
China started the virus. We are in deep trouble because of it. But now we thank them because they had mercy on us and gave us 1000 ventilators? Governor, I like your press conferences, your organization skills, and how you present yourself as a leader but I hate your policies.
Oregon my state. Thank you to all the governors who are doing whatever they can to protect our healthcare workers and everyone regardless of the lack of care from the federal government.
@NYGovCuomo needs to resign. He's stopping sick patients from getting hydroxychloriquine unless they're in the official study. THIS IS CRIMINAL! I know someone in NY that needs this NOW! @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle  …
Thank CCP for making a deadly, and then selling faulty medical 
Allow IMGs and those who didnt match to work and pay them. They are ready, willing and able. Let them help! And then help them after with residency spots or pathway to practice! @UnmatchedMD some are even specialists in other countries.
It's sad that Americans thank China after the CCP spread out viruses to the world. The CCP set fire, burnt your house, passed a bucket of muddy water, then you're kowtowing. As Chinese I don't understand how ppl could be so naïve and ignorant. Not only a war is a WAR. Wake

Dear @NYGovCuomo: great! However: all physicians (including residents & medical students) need to be PAID for their service. They’re risking their lives, & family lives, but shouldn’t have to risk their livelihoods. If they are from outside NYC, they also need housing. #COVID19
The state is responsible for the state. Cuomo didn’t buy ventilators two years ago
And Belle, we (NY) promise, when your  we will be there for Oregon
This isn’t about politics or power, it’s about people’s lives. @BOENYC employees have died. #cancelpetitionchallenges and allow democracy to go on in the safest possible way during this #CoronavirusPandemic Time is of the essence @NYGovCuomo  …

Fck China, & fck you 
Cuomo in coronavirus briefing earlier this week stated he will sign an EO & send Natl Guard to seize other institutions ventilators currently unused. Now denies he’ll ‘seize’ ventilators stating he doesn’t like the word seize. Instead he will seize them but call it ‘sharing’ 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the shipment from China is expected to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday  …
NY Governor Andrew Cuomo is SEIZING medical equipment from those who prepared for the future AND paid for it, and "redistributing" it, because because people like HIM did NOT prepare. He calls it SHARING. This is your Socialist Communism on display. ENJOY IT!
Isn't the military running the Javits Center? Just want clarification before Trump blames Gov. @NYGovCuomo
You are lucky! He’s a strong leader!
Thank you @NYGovCuomo You are working so HARD Wishing you STRENGTH Please SHARE THIS. #ILoveNY #NewYorkTough  …
Good question. Or maybe everyone in New York is as stupid as @NYGovCuomo and @BilldeBlasio ?
I think first we'll focus on uninformed trolls who quote Fox News for Dummies.
I don't know who needs to hear this but @NYGovCuomo is cutting Medicaid while COVID-19 is ravaging our state.
100%. The assumptions behind @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor’s decision to cancel spring break are offensive. I don’t know any students and families who are purposely ignoring social distancing rules. But I do know lots of families & kids who are desperate for a break from academics.
@NYGovCuomo should be getting his face off of the TV screen and get back to work. Oh wait, he hasn't been working which is why NY is upside-down right now. 
As another Oregonian, this has my whole-hearted blessing! Our peak may still  but so far we have a low number of cases. This is the best time for us to help others.
New York is poorly run.
@NYGovCuomo has done an excellent job 
Racism is also a pandemic. It hits our members, hard, in COVID @NYGovCuomo #CancelRent  …
So Governor Cuomo just signed an Executive Order for the National Guard to seize & redistribute ventilators, masks & other medical supplies to use as he sees fit... But the Federal Government can't according to MSM Retweet if you’re sick of the hypocrisy Follow

The CCP praises your kind words. 
I don’t care who the drug cartels are linked too, but they need to be smashed. That is the real war that the USA & the world needs to be fighting as these drugs kill many more people than the Coronavirus will ever reach.

Funny you never publicly thank the US government and  who have given you thousands of ventilators.
Probably all infected with the Chinese virus.
It’s a travesty in #Brooklyn that hundreds of cyclists and runners are packed into Prospect Park while the empty streets around the park continue to be reserved for cars. So much for social distancing cc @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @NYCSpeakerCoJo 
My sister's love for @NYGovCuomo has developed into Bingo-board crating. 
I sincerely hope so because I don’t know what any of us will do if they retain office in Nov.

Cuomo: China And Oregon Sending Ventilators to NYC After Trump/Kushner Failed to Provide

Holy crap guy. Get your head straight. 
Wow! Thank you, Governor Cuomo. I agree. 
America hasn’t abandoned New York Unbelievable All the supplies by the millions sent to them, a hospital ship that sits almost empty Blame Cuomo for wasting money instead of preparing for emergency! Of all places NY should know better!
NYC Governor Andrew Cuomo says the NBA is contributing 1 million surgical masks to New York's essential workers. Cuomo specifically says the Knicks, Nets and China's Consul General Huang Ping led the charge.
Try to be current....and relevant.
Why do Chinese government officials get their hands into everything “to help” everyone, everywhere? Doesn’t anyone find that a bit peculiar?
It’s the least China can

Boy Sean is hot for Cuomo today.. I work the front line here in New York and we have no choice but to crowd what do you want us to let them die Sean, that drug has not been proven safe I hope your viewers don't listen to you once again, you're not a Doctor to be saying anything.

We are aware of that, and it’s not enough. It’s a shame our President didn’t take the advice of scientists and medical experts back in January.
What we need is homicide charges to be brought against @seanhannity. And a huge class action lawsuit.
Oh my god I cried. The governors voice saying what he did is awesome. He is strong he is resolute he is with out a doubt the person that should be in charge of New York. Thank god for him being at the helm
The CCP is the virus. Wake up.
Wow, the “LOOK OVER HERE” is strong with Shammity 
Not to “all people” this, but wiping student debt at least for anyone who’s working to keep things going would be a smart move. There’s a lot of essential & frontline workers who have student debt, from grocery workers to lab techs to mechanics & IT support.

How DARE @NYGovCuomo publicly thank China for finally sending 1000 ventilators to New York City when the American government has provided astounding amounts of medical equipment AND assistance including a hospital ship to New York City from the beginning
Gov Mario Cuomo could not be more proud of his sons today. His decency, determination, grit, strength and courage are clearly in their DNA. Thank you @NYGovCuomo for abating some of our fear and holding up a shining example of leadership during our darkest days. God Bless You

That's.. Now how practicing medicine should work, actually. Find a setup that keeps them safe and pay them, but.. That's not how that works.
Let’s be clear: Hannitys attack on Gov Cuomo are at direct request of Trump or with trumps okay. Hannity has never deviated from trumps messaging.
These are some of the 140 ventilators @OregonGovBrown is sending to New York. Photos courtesy of Press Sec. Charles Boyle, who says that @NYGovCuomo requested them from every state in the country. "Today we are able to respond to New York’s call for ventilators," 
Dear New Yorkers, You elect your officials. You pay state and city taxes to those you elected. They deem what is suited to spend that money on. Cuomo was warned about lack of ventilators and quality of hospitals for years. He chose to spend that money on environmental progress.
"This is the Cuomo playbook." @NYGovCuomo is reportedly pressuring @JoeBiden's camp to feature him on the 2020 ticket. "There is no question in my mind he would want to go for 
Pretty sure he knows. Pretty sure he cares. But pretty sure NYC is being hit freaking hard and needs motivation like this. Be thoughtful.
It was  to NY in 2015 that they were severely under supplied. Cuomo ignored the  and used the money he could’ve spent on vents to fund solar panels and fluorescent light bulbs. You can’t make this shit up! Negligence to the people of New York!
Maybe you should have bought them when you were supposed to, I live in Buffalo, you spent $750 million on a solar energy plant, where is it, better yet where is the money? Same as the $90 million for the lightbulb factory in Syracuse. No factory, where’s the

As Oregonian I salute you 
Why don’t you sit this one out,  …
The federal government sent 5,000 ventilators, a massive hospital ship and converted massive convention centers into hospitals in NY. How is that not responsive?
I just watched a tape where you called the #COVID19 a hoax. You need to be investigated stat for misleading the public and causing deaths. Stop now.
Funny how Ivanka and Jared work at the WH cause their dad is president.
Oh and @RealDonaldTrump and @Potus gave NY the Governor 4,400 ventilators that Governor Cuomo put in the “warehouse” . @NYGovCuomo . @NYCMayor #EpicFailNY
First somebody had to explain to Trump what a hospital ship was, and that the American military possesses them. Then somebody needed to tell him that it would be good for his approval #'s if he sent the ships. Trump couldn't hold Cuomo's hand sanitizer.

I’m ashamed to be a citizen of New York at this moment in time. @NYGovCuomo Medicaid cut of 2.5B is going to affect thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers who depend on it. I cannot stop the tears because I’m worried for my father’s health. What wrong have we done for this?
Gov. Cuomo is mistaken when he says New York is a "microcosm" of America, and that as NY goes with COVID-19 outbreak, so goes the rest of the country. For starters, New York is magnet for foreign travelers spreading the virus & what's more, people live on top of each other in NYC
So they were supposed to prepare for a pandemic Trump told the country was contained and would go to zero in days? Why didn’t Trump prepare for the last 3 years instead of spending billions on a useless wall? You’ve got to go Sean. Your bullshit is contagious and deadly.
Please join me to send off @PatriceAPilon with cheers! She is answering the call by @NYGovCuomo for help. She's an RN and is headed from #Boston to #NYC to work in a #COVID19 hospital. Brave #nurse who will work 21 days straight.

And Obama didn’t restock, retool. Ignored experts advice.
Oh god is this really him? I have an amazing image of him kicking open the door to a warehouse full of ventilators while Jared angrily protests and then gets punched in the stomach and goes down like a sack of potatoes. Alexa, order popcorn. 5 weeks delivery? DAMNIT.

Thank you – The state of Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to NY – garden hose quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt @nygovcuomo 
Cuomo is in charge of the State's preparedness. We pay too many taxes to excuse this mismanagement.
If anyone took the time to analyze the deaths in NY they would find that @NYGovCuomo is doing the exact same thing
A doctor.... With an account from march 2020...with 100 followers... Only going after Cuomo... Might be a coincidence.... But... Blocked
Governor, I applaud your hard work and efforts in this fight but putting these students on the frontlines without any training, education, support, the testing and the PPE, simply bc they are med students is dangerous and reckless. You cannot do this without ensuring their safety
When President Cuomo says outside is legal again 
Are you kidding? He has been all over the place doing interviews and virtual appearances. He has a Covid town hall tomorrow night. It’s probably a good idea if you actually look before stating false 
Also these Med students didn’t all match in New York - who is training them, covering their malpractice and paying them? Residents don’t even have a full license to practice medicine. They are supervised. Med students are a precious resource that need to be protected.
Just asking nicely, where is that happening? Nurses are the first in line to be exposed, by having initial contact through triage and patient assessment. If a patient rings for assistance it's the RN who answers the call Bell. Dr.'s & Nurses should all

“Seize is a harsh kind of word.. I prefer ‘share’ - let’s call it SHARING - you will SHARE your private property with the government. It WILL BE redistributed!” @NYGovCuomo Hm.. heard that one before: 1930s collectivization in Russia 1948 Czechoslovakia 1956 Hungary... 
Looking forward to the airlift of pizza, bagels and taxis when the Cascadia earthquake hits

Clear the Student Debt of all Doctors and nurses who have answered the call to help. They deserve that much and more.
Just 5 of NY's 40 Democratic senators voted against Cuomo's budget, which slashed Medicaid spending by billions & rolled backed the 2019 bail reform. Common thread: 4 of the 5 ousted Dem incumbents in progressive challenges last cycle. (Remember the IDC?)
NEW YORK GETS 1000 VENTILATORS FROM CHINA Absence of a functional Federal system, requires Governor to source life or death medical gear. @HHSGov @NYGovCuomo #hero #china  …
Gov. Cuomo says Chinese government donated 1,000 ventilators to New York 
. @NRA, do you think this is a good time to file a lawsuit against a governor dealing w/the worse #COVID19 hit state in the country. Selling more guns is more important to you than saving lives. This is personal to me. My 21-yr-old son is in NYC alone. Let @NYGovCuomo do his job.
Hey, @NYGovCuomo have you read that Upstaters would like to keep our Healthcare right where it is
When we go back to school, will it be safe for kids to be in class sizes of 32 or 34? Surely #COVID2019 will still be a threat and having densely packed classrooms will be a bad idea. Too bad @NYGovCuomo just robbed public schools so he wouldn’t have to tax rich people.
The President of The United States is holding medical equipment until Governor Cuomo works out a deal with the Southern District of New York. Drop the cases, or people die. That’s the deal.

While he’s played ‘pandemic President‘ for the cameras, Andrew Cuomo strong-armed the NY state budget with billions in cuts to Medicaid which will undermine hospitals, nursing homes, and home care workers.  …
Because the this and Deblasio telling citizens in 3/3/2020 to ride the subway, go to parades was 
The concept is called “resource-sharing” and the goal is to move needed supplies around to where they’re needed. This is the solution to the president willingly withholding help and causing unneeded chaos during a pandemic.
Love from Southern California to NY ! May we all get through this before the year is over, and protect each other, by staying home. My parents are from Brooklyn & Queens , still have much family there. Hang in there NY!! You are tough & strong 
We need #PPE #Loanforgiveness #hazardpay
Massachusetts loves you, New York!! Great vid, Convicts! xoxo
@POTUS When does the crying stop @NYGovCuomo and the governing begin? If you can't take the heat then get out of the kitchen. @AOC is so damn smart, ask her how to hatch some ventilators. Can't feel sorry for a state when the people elect dummies.  
More than 7,000 Americans are dead. And you are back with old grievances? Just stop. For once, could you PLEASE try, just try, to act like a leader that America needs? You know...like @JoeBiden and @NYGovCuomo
because they blind about China and they are not able to learn things outside of their pride and prejudice.

I am working to support @NYGovCuomo 's efforts to find licensed healthcare professionals to help with the coronavirus crisis response in New York State. So grateful to all of those already working to keep us safe, but we need thousands more personnel: I'd love your help --
Pointing out the absurdity of a resident already 250k in debt risking their life for minimum wage while nurses take in 50k a month in hazard pay is not “belittling nurses”
It’s a sad state of affairs when this BS originated in China, they lied and continue to lie about the number of deaths and lethality of COVID-19, and then they get kudos for sending token number of critical equipment. They should be sending plane loads around the world!
So you take away something that helps heal lungs, while leaving the entire country to smoke cancer sticks.. you’d rather have money than have people be safe. It’s people like you that make me hope hell is real cuz I’d love to know you’re burning for eternity @NYGovCuomo  …
. @NYGovCuomo accepts 1,000 ventilators from China as New York battles the coronavirus. “This is a big deal, and it’s going to make a significant difference for us,” said Cuomo, revealing that Oregon would also be making donations. 
I hope so...my horrible governor @NYGovCuomo is trying to create more smokers in NY. He is banning everything...but to quote him "So what" we will find a way to keep vaping as it is healthier than smoking

No they don’t. You know how I know? I’m a doctor with loans. The programs which have been set up are essentially impossible to use. We can’t deduct anything from our taxes on interest paid on loans. I graduated with $440,000 in loans and delayed starting a family to do this.
Governor Cuomo when I look at the job you are doing I think of one of my favorite quotes. I actually put it on my page in your honor. If you are going through hell, keep going. Winston Churchill #CoronavirusPandemic #SaturdayThoughts
Thank you China for firebombing the rest of the world's houses and then selling them defective firehoses to put out the flames while you walk off with the profit. Are you sure these were "donated?" Compare:   …
Governor Cuomo gave his update early today. An estimated 53 million Americans simultaneously wished he was our President.
For... a crisis... they created. Fascinating take.
Exactly how many patients are on ventilators at this time Cuomo?

Thank you very much, “Acting President, @NYGovCuomo.”  …

Not in New York with the cement head Cuomo in charge.
This is the regime that Andrew Cuomo is praising today for “facilitating” the donation of vents. 
Just 1 example how bad @NYGovCuomo FCKD us.Last month NYC ban forced my Manhattan store to close, now with 2 shops in Rockland County where #covid19 is ravaging our families(4K cases) our shops are closed so we can’t liquidate our stock in 45 days law takes effect. 
Quite sure my wife, I, & our daughter had this in late Jan/early Feb. Been here a long time. Decent chance a large chunk of the PDX area was already infected, which is why our caseload is relatively low and growing slowly. With SD measures in place, we can help elsewhere.
Yes! We can conquer it !!!!!! God bless America but not trump
Pretty sure the virus originated in China and the Chinese Government has been lying about the severity of said virus since the beginning but yea let’s thank the Chinese government
We’re not hoarding. We’re locked down, our curve is flattening, and we have more hospital capacity than we ended up needing as a result. So, we’re helping. Maybe sit this one out. The Pac NW has been living with this disease since Christmas. We’re way ahead.
Same for nurses, NPs, CRNAs, PAs etc. Talk is cheap (you’re heroes!!!!) Our clinicians are dying at record rates putting themselves in harms way daily, without adequate equipment. Walk the talk (PPE, Loan forgiveness, hazard pay)
According to the model everyone is using, New York has enough ventilators.  
I'm a nurse in Seattle and we are getting NOTHING. Stop trying to split us. We shouldn't be fighting each other, we should be fighting for our patients. Your displaced anger is meant for Trump. Do better.

Why would you trust the Chinese? They lied,sent faulty supplies and started this virus .. you'd support this , I feel sorry for you
This whole exchange here is truly beautiful.
Dear, @NYGovCuomo I admire you for fighting for every single life.
Thank you for doing this! @StonyBrookMed is graduating us on Wednesday, & I’ll be starting to work @NYUWinthropHosp the day after. There are hundreds of doctors that have gone unmatched @TheNRMP who want to help out! I urge you & other governors to find work for these doctors!
#TrumpMustGo #ImpeachTrumpAgain Holding @NYGovCuomo hostage with medical equipment (to get criminal charges lifted?) is SO MUCH worse than extorting Ukraine. Look at the death toll.  
This is part of the larger project by physicians to subjugate nurses and treat them as lesser than, even during a time of crisis, y’all can’t help but belittle nurses. Wild
Also Chinese doctors concluded that ventilator alone is not the effective method to save patients. Check this article below  
I'm an Oregonian and I'm so happy our Governor took this step. We are all in this together. We love you NY, hang in there!
Lol. They already know the answer but they refuse to accept it. Also They are allergic to the fact that trump failed to respond and take the rona situation under control.
Yep. Another lawsuit. This time in federal court....And we are not going to stop until @NYGovCuomo @NYSDOCCS starts freeing our clients. #FreeThemAll  …
Thank goodness for China and Russia helping out our inept government with medical supplies!

Dude, nice try. What the hell were you doing or saying about epidemic readiness? Please post some links to your past tweets expressing your concern about this. While you're at it, get @BilldeBlasio & @NYGovCuomo to do the same. Nice try attempting to pass blame, clown!  
I love @NYGovCuomo and his reply to the latest NRA lawsuit. “ The NRA is suing me again? oh. I guess that’s about a dozen times. I wish we could be immune to this virus the way I am immune to NRA lawsuits."
Not sure if public is aware that physicians are being asked to volunteer in NY right now without protection, hazard pay and benefits. Meanwhile nurses are being offered up to $13K a week. If Cuomo really wants more doctors, he should offer to PAY them.
I have been in reg contact with @NYGovCuomo’s staff. However, Rockland’s situation is worsening. County of 300,000+ now has highest per capita cases in the US. Need new coordinated plan for enforcement & supplies & field hospital ASAP @jessemckinley @GannettAlbany @nancyrockland

China doesn’t care about anyone but themselves, they are trying to deflect that they made the CCP virus spread all over the world by covering it up for months. By making it seem like they are saving the world when in fact they caused all these problems.

We need to protect the various providers we have not send newly minted ones to the slaughter.
China has donated 1,000 ventilators to New York as the U.S. state battles an extraordinary outbreak of COVID-19. “This is a big deal and it’s going to make a significant difference for us,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.

Really? This is other worldly. You’re thanking the country that gave the planet this mess? Dear God.
The political stupidity never ceases to amaze me. Hundreds of thousands of ventilators are needed, in the history of the world we have never even needed 10% of the ventilators we need today. Be happy we got a gift from China and move on, and stop the divisive tweets!!
I don't follow him closely but has he issued any sort of similar thank you to the federal government? Gushing about China is so cringy!
Pres Trump sent 4,000 ventilators to NY. GOV Cuomo has them in storage in Elmhurst, NJ.
Cuomo said 630 people died in New York yesterday due to coronavirus. The sirens are constant. It's impossible to explain to people who don't live here how it doesn't feel actively scary to be here despite what it looks like on TV, but it's also draining, dystopian, and traumatic.
You're doing a great job governor. I wish you would handle the whole damn country. I trust you. I believe in you
Tweets sent by @realDonaldTrump today: 39 Ventilators sent by @realDonaldTrump to NY after Cuomo requests 17,000: ZERO Ventilators sent to NY by China after Cuomo request: 1,000 Ventilators sent by Oregon Gov. Kate Brown to NY: 140 Trump seems to *want* New Yorkers to die.
We’re starting our monthly meeting on Zoom hearing from @marriabau on @NYGovCuomo’s immoral budget . We’re wondering why the @UFT didn’t use their immense people power to lobby against unnecessary cuts to education & Medicaid.

You all are so fortune to have Brown’s leadership. The situation calls for decisive action and she really came though! Ditto for Inslee and Newsom.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. NYS will repay the favor when Oregon needs 
Make sure they work!
Will there be an executive order wiping clean all of their debt from medical school? If not, this is simply taking advantage of young, eager doctors. They are risking their lives to save humanity. They need PPE & they need loan forgiveness. CC: @NYGovCuomo  …
Where did he say they will be taking care of Covid patients? It’s about lessening the load so the more experienced doctors can handle this.
Just saw this. @JCColtin, how long have you been covering us? That’s the pin that @NYGovCuomo and every member of the administration wear. The ‘I’ is everyone who works here.  
China should forgive all US debt for getting us in this crisis in the first place
But we both lost people now, save them ,stop fight for a moment
#CoronavirusUpdate: @NYGovCuomo will sign an Executive Order to allow medical students graduating this spring the ability to begin practicing now. This will bring much-needed reinforcements to our medical system. Thank you in advance to these students. We need your help!
. @NYGovCuomo is doing NOTHING to protect homeless NYers. For scale: Right now NYC is paying for 500 isolation hotel rooms for the homeless. We need 30K rooms to protect ppl in crowded shelters, on the street, and ppl  homeless. And what about the rest of the state?!  …
After our first #StayHome 'request' a few weeks ago and then everyone flocked to the beach, Gov Brown said the idiots blew it, time to shut'er down for real. And that's why, so far, we seem to be beating this thing - and can now help New York.
I really don't understand why people are talking about Sanders like his campaign is dead, when he's been extremely active or about Cuomo like he's not bad, which he is. Here's a great piece on this by @lyta_gold at  …
Women, especially black women need to have a seat at the table. I know some of you are hoping tht Biden selects Andrew Cuomo as his VP but I don't support that. Black ppl are tired of being slighted. We showed up to save his candidacy. Our women shouldn't be overlooked...again!

The Chinese government isn't a shipping clerk
SOME GOOD NEWS: As New York searches for more ventilators to treat coronavirus patients, the State of #Oregon surprised @NYGovCuomo with 140 new ventilators and a deal for 1,000 units donated from China came through:  #covid-19 #nyc #ny #cbsnewyork
I love how @NYGovCuomo treats press with respect. This is stark contrast to @realDonaldTrump. Also loved response to being sued by the NRA. I feel like we are preparing for new normal after @gop gets slaughtered in November

The highlight of the day is having coffee in California watching Cuomo in New York keeping the nation in the loop.

Forreal, Jack Ma is not the CCP. But I'm still skeptical of quality assurance for products in China currently.
I live in Queens & this is not true. The NY hotspot started in New Rochelle, & the first known NYC case was a middle-aged white man. Please take your racism elsewhere.
I agree with the previous poster. Dbl check everything. Trojan horses are inevitable. I do trust Jack Ma but that is it.
So then, since Covid-19 won't affect your state, you won't be needed your ventilators then? Might I ask you @BrianKempGA send then to @NYGovCuomo please sir?
So, the @NRA is suing Governor Andrew Cuomo for deeming gun stores a non-essential business. Cuomo just basically told them to go to hell and that they were irrelevant in not so many words. Love it.
Chinese government downplayed the virus and delayed their response for one month. US government downplayed the virus and delayed their response for three months. Our current condition has much more to do with our own government's poor judgment.
They drove a truck through your living room and gave you a hammer, I’d hold my applause.
#BREAKING: Cuomo announces record 10,841 jump for new coronavirus cases in one day  
Trumps answer to this scenario would be..... 'Which neighbour woud like to pay me for lending their hose to put out my fire'.............and would any other Neighbours like to offer a higher bid?
Guess who voted in favor of @NYGovCuomo death bill? Our Lower East Side & parts of Brooklyn, Senator @BrianKavanaghNY shame on him! Bill Cuts: 1. Medicaid during a pandemic 2. Education funds + not having the funds needed is the diff of quality + equity in  1/
Your briefing today was very revealing. Reporter: “The Federal Govt said they sent more vents to NY yesterday. Is that true?” Cuomo: “Yes, that is correct.” Reporter: “How many?” Cuomo: “We don’t know.” Also Cuomo: We have 500 vents sitting unused hospitals statewide 
When world history books are written, this pandemic will be the turning point between American hegemony and Chinese hegemony.
As a New Yorker, I want to thank the people of the State of Oregon and Governor Kate Brown @OregonGovBrown for showing America, and our federal government, what the UNITED States really stands for. Thank you Oregon for sharing ventilators! #OregonNewYorkUnity
If @TheDemocrats want @NYGovCuomo as their nominee why not just run him against Bernie right now? Why swap @JoeBiden out for @NYGovCuomo at the convention? If they do this then people are going to be pissed.
I put one together that they can use for the fed 
Then swears it never happened and his supporters take to twitter and say it never happened it’s all left wing propaganda. How’d I do?
When someone volunteers to go into a situation without proper PPE and could die, the least we could do is pay off their loans if they survive.
They didn’t treat a real patient in their life yet. I’m talking about certified and experienced doctors that we are ignoring.

As a native New Yorker, you Rock@NYGovCuomo. I’m stuck in Florida, with a Donald Trump asskisser as our Governor. Ron DeSantis has no regard for human life . He’s putting his loyalty to Donald Trump before his Oath of Office to We, the people. Sad!
Meet them at the airport if you can. The feds have been seizing shipments!

Horrific that @NYGovCuomo has to go right to the Chinese to get ventilators bc @realDonaldTrump is too vicious, vindictive,  & filled with hate & resentment  through for thousands people in his home state simply because they didn’t vote for him. Sick. Just sick.
It’s beautiful 
. @NYGovCuomo “Javits Center is 2500 beds which will be significant relief valve and will be staffed by fed govt” ; 2/3rd of people hospitalized have been discharged...
If you drop the words "federal government", the statement is still accurate.
"Suppose my neighbor's home catches fire & I have a length of garden hose. If he can take my garden hose, I may help him put out his fire. I don't say to him 'Neighbor, you have to pay me $15 for it.' I don't want $15. I want my garden hose back after the fire is over." ⁠⁠-FDR

. @NYGovCuomo says it’s fair to say the 2020 legislative session is “effectively over.” Budget passed this week, and lawmakers unlikely to return for second half.
Yes that's a great idea for med students to take care of Covid patients without adequate PPE!! Send them on a suicide mission. You don't care how many people you put in harm's way. You don't care how many physicians have to die because of YOUR mistakes and inaction.
Day 33 of @NYGovCuomo's emergency powers & still no relief for incarcerated elders. Despite pleas from families, lawyers, and newspapers. Despite governors freeing people across the country. Despite our first #COVID19 death in prison. This is now part of Cuomo's legacy.
How can anyone argue that Andrew Cuomo is not doing the best he possibly can? What's wrong with the people of USA?
A virus. Plain and Simple and case 
Oregonian here who watches your briefings every day. Thank you to both governors for your leadership and unity. Our hearts are with you NY.

Are you kidding? The #ChineseCommunistParty infected us with the #CCPVirus.
Here's how New York is tracking relative to @NYGovCuomo's Coronavirus ICU forecast: 
Don’t let trump divert the plane for “his” stockpile @NYGovCuomo
"There is no repository that is going to have everything we need" @NYGovCuomo on likelihood NY will not have enough ventilators for the peak, "You go to war with what you have"
Oregon is lending NY 140 ventilators, per @NYGovCuomo, who says, "We will return it double-fold."
"You go to war with what you have not what you need" -- @NYGovCuomo
Close, Trump is fine with China, all his craptastic Maga hat are made there. His biggest fear is America applauding President Cuomo over him
> @NYGovCuomo just announced that Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to New York even though it was unsolicited. He describes it as lending your neighbor a garden hose as his house is on fire.... It also answers the question: "What would #Jesus do?" Right  …
Thank you, Governor Brown, and thank you Governor Cuomo!
They didn't beg. We sent them without a request. #OregonProud
Uhh. Sure. But who fucking started the problem to begin with
"It is like a fire spreading...it consumes where it is and then it moves" @NYGovCuomo says the virus is spreading east toward Long Island
The feds have been actually seizing ppe shipments bound for blue states.
Cuomo asked Trump for 17,000 vents. He got ZERO. Don't forget that. Don't ever forget it.
The state of Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to NY. We are so grateful to @OregonGovBrown and the people of Oregon. On behalf of the people of NY, I thank you and rest assured that NY will repay the favor when Oregon needs it.
I like how Cuomo’s slides are just spoken word poetry now 
the chinese government is the one who covered this up for months, they still haven't even released the real number of those who died. I wouldn't even trust those supplies look at the supplies italy and spain got they were defective or used.
The day when the Chinese government is more responsive to your emergency than your own Federal Government.
This is great news but a humiliation to America caused by @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP. America should be able to provide for itself.
Oregon sent ventilators to NYC. But officials in Erie County don’t want to? I don’t think you guys get this. We are in this together. As @NYGovCuomo just said, stop the fire before it spreads to your house . NYC’s FIGHT IS OUR FIGHT ONE NEW YORK STATE—NO MORE POLITICS
New Yorkers must be proud...you are a great governor!
China is gaining most by this coronavirus. They are establishing their business in US now. By selling.
We finally got some good news today. The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive in JFK today. I thank the Chinese government, Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, the Jack Ma Foundation, the Tsai Foundation and Consul General Huang.
The Acting President of the US. @NYGovCuomo
Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to New York, @NYGovCuomo says 
I would like @NYGovCuomo PowerPoint slides on all of the states 
Can somebody tell me  certainty that the #ChineseVirus death totals we are being fed daily, are not being lumped together with deaths from the ordinary Flu ? #CoronaVirusTaskForce #ChineseWuhanVirus @NYGovCuomo
Yesterday @NYGovCuomo lied to reporters during his press conference on #COVID19 -- saying there was nothing he could do to reduce the population in his prisons. Will Albany press corps press him on this today? @JonCampbellGAN @JCColtin @ZackFinkNews @J__Velasquez @jessemckinley
Cuomo says New York ordered 17,000 ventilators from the federal government. Says the state was willing to pay. New York got ZERO from our government. Simply unforgivable! Instead is getting 1,000 from China and 140 from the state of Oregon. Bless you ⁦ 
Cuomo just announced that Joe Tsai and Jack Ma from Ali Baba have donated 1000 ventilators to NY. Oregon is sending 140. Cuomo is getting it done by the skin of his teeth, thank the gods.
Chinese government facilitating donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive at JFK today, @NYGovCuomo says.
I live in CA and listen to Gov. Cuomo and Dr. Dena Grayson for the facts. They alleviate my anxiety. @NYGovCuomo @DrDenaGrayson
NEW: @NYGovCuomo says Chinese government is sending 1000 ventilators, arriving at JFK today.
The Federal Government will staff and equip 2,500 beds in Javits for COVID patients. This is a dramatic help in our battle against time, spread and lacking hospital capacity. Reducing the strain on NYC area hospitals is a top priority.
. @NYGovCuomo says he's authorizing medical students slated to graduate this spring to begin practicing medicine immediately.
. @NYGovCuomo says his state ordered 17-thousand ventilators and says  the national stockpile was about 10K. The president said yesterday states should have ordered more earlier.
Every time I see Gov. Cuomo on his briefings I get a sense of relief... however, today his voice sounds broken! How much more can Cuomo endure? His trying so hard to save his ppl.. fighting day and night! I salute YOU GOV CUOMO!Your efforts will not go unnoticed.We pray for YOU!
Who appointed @NYGovCuomo to hold daily briefings about #coronavirus for America? Can stand to listen to him for more than 30 seconds. Sounds like Charlie Brown’s teacher. Wa wa wa wa wa.
Incarcerated people at one of @NYGovCuomo prisons have been physically assaulted by guards as retaliation for protesting conditions of confinement.  …
An encouraging stat from @NYGovCuomo: Two-thirds of COVID-19 hospitalizations have been discharged.
Cuomo: Two-thirds of hospitalized patients in NYS have been discharged.
This is the worst part of the day for @realDonaldTrump He’s got to watch a REAL LEADER in action, and it kills him to know that the rest of the USA is watching too. All he has is his little “Trump’s Dog & Pony Show of Alternative Facts” each day at 5.
Gov Cuomo giving daily briefing on @ABC7NY...says two thirds of the people who have been hospitalized have now been discharged, not at the apex yet, sadly death toll in NYS rises to more than 3,500 @ABC7NYNewsDesk #covid #ny @NYGovCuomo

Oh great, more national coverage of @NYGovCuomo who yesterday increased incarceration at a time when DECARCERATION is a public health imperative #SayNoToCuomo
How to make a bad interview - put it on CNN. How to make it doubly bad - add the Cuomo brothers. How to make it triply bad - have them lavish ridiculous praise on Biden. Anyone wonder why @CNN ratings are in the tank?? (I follow back

Thank you, @yuhline, for standing up for our values with such clarity. This is the kind of bold  leadership we need in this moment, @NYGovCuomo “Why is it harder to tax the rich than to kill the poor?” -  …
COVID-19 continues to spread & kill in NYS prisons. Yesterday, @NYGovCuomo said he doesn't have the tools to #StopTheSpread by reducing the prison population. That's a lie. He can grant #ClemencyNow to anyone he wants. Updated COVID-19 numbers show he must act now:  
The rescue search for Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean and her son Gideon has been suspended with the pair tragically presumed dead. Another unspeakable tragedy for the Kennedy family. @NYGovCuomo was related to them by marriage. Maeve’s mother was his ex wife’s sister.

The whole country is listening Mr. Cuomo, you're one of the few leaders, that give it to us straight, and we thank you for that keep fighting the fight, you're a very important part of America.

Okay, @NYGovCuomo, it’s time for you to start listening to people that know WTH they’re talking about. In more ways than one, @USBornNRaised is on the front lines of this war. Listen to her, & stop pontificating. Act!

Nearly a day after announcing it, a @NYGovCuomo executive order regarding the taking of ventilators from upstate hospitals for use in downstate hospitals still hasn't posted on his website. 
CNN is so distrusted and discredited, I see countless people who believe Cuomo and Baldwin are making up their illness to increase attention to themselves. This tells you just how self-damaged CNN’s credibility now is. This skepticism would’ve been unheard of 10 yrs ago.

e-cigarettes are at least 95% less harmfull than cigarettes, yet Cuomo left cigarettes on the shelves. Now that`s something to think about. It has nothing to do with peoples health, that`s what you want the wider public to believe.
Alright @NYGovCuomo it is time for you to step aside and let real “physicians “ prescribe hydroxychloroquine and a Z-pak to all Coronovirus pts to avoid hospitalization. It saved my family members life in NY 4 days ago. Why prevent people from getting better?
DT sent the PPE & masks to #NewYork depot then #NewYork has to bid for the equipment along w/ foreign countries & all the other states. So when they announced they're sending to NY, they're sending it to resellers. @NYGovCuomo says this all time.
Yet another zealot who has no regard for human life. Absolutely no scientific data to back up that statement. You weren't trusted by the people to be president, why should they trust you with the #COVID19Pandemic?

First, BrieBrie does an unprovoked attack on Kamala Harris. Next, Krystal ball does an unprovoked attack on Gov Cuomo. Then, Shaun King does an unprovoked attack on Brian Schatz. I'm starting to see a pattern here. This is coordination. That can  from the top.
Democrat voters don’t seem to care if their Presidential candidates have dementia like Joe Biden.
For those who don't know I'll just leave this right

Age-restricted sales: good enough for EVERY other consumer product, including cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana... Not enough for ecigs though. Only a ban will do "to protect the kids". Nothing to do with cig sales falling through the floor, and tax and MSA receipts dropping, then?
#RT @ColorOfChange: . @NYGovCuomo decision to move forward a budget gutting bail reform during #COVID_19 is cruel & inhumane. He's putting Black & brown lives at risk. These rollbacks would subject up to 15K more ppl to pretrial jailing each year,

President Trump is killing our doctors and our nurses. Not providing them with PPE that they need. He's killing patients, not providing them with ventilators. When he kills the doctors the patients can't get medical care. Trump has to be removed from office. Trump is a murderer.

Gov Cuomo has done some really great things, getting shit together in a city whose mayor couldn't be bothered to take the event of a century seriously. And then Cuomo issued an order to take, by force, the ventilators from everyone in the state who *did* take this seriously.
Those precious kids were buying vapor products illegally. @JUULvapor thanks New York lawmakers from the bottom of their hearts.

@JustinTrudeau IS using someone’s words - Butts’. And all his answers are vetted & scripted. Completely inauthentic. Totally non leader qualities. He looks, sounds and is perhaps insincere and definitely cannot be totally honest with Canada

IKR? #Hydroxychloroquine needs to be given to everyone in NY!! Listen to Trump @NYGovCuomo
Lucky you, if you live in New York State. If you want HydroxyCloroquine, you can't have your doctor prescribe it and pick it up at your local pharmacy. No, no that would be too easy. You are mandated to go the hospital and get it. Best of luck. Cuomo is in a Coma. You hired him.

. @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo I’m shocked at how many times I’ve seen people spitting on sidewalks during walks to the store in NYC, which is appalling to say the least. Can we get a PSA on @LinkNYC screens reminding people that this is unacceptable during #COVID19 (or any time, really)
And Trudeau hides and Ford is out front and center
DEMAND the tests and the PPE's. A live hero can save more lives than a sick or dead hero. People cheering for the medical personnel, please add 'GIVE THEM PPE's, GIVE THEM TESTS' to your cheers. Save their/your lives! MAKE the government and the billionaire crew act now!
I'm gonna withhold praise of Cuomo. I like governnors that DONT want cuts to medicare before or DURING a pandemic.
We are people too @NYGovCuomo ! We deserve a fighting chance as well . By the time we hit our apex we will have no vents or supplies if you take everything from us . Your supposed to be protecting ALL LIVES in NY #UpstateLivesMatter
Why wasn't it unacceptable on Tuesday, @UFTUnity, when you celebrated @NYGovCuomo on the verge of massive education cuts in our state budget, for making us work Spring Break? You left @UFT with no leverage, which allowed @NYCMayor and @DOEChancellor to take the rest of our days!
@UFT @NYCSchools @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo it may be hard to believe, but the teachers are going to burn out if you don't give us any breaks. Some of us are in mourning for people who we've lost to this pandemic, some of us have families of our own to care for. #disrespectfuldeblasio
Hint: he’s already doing that. Also shipped tons to China, now we have to buy them back. @NYGovCuomo in near tears as he cannot get enough vents for all the peeps in #NYC. BUT He’s trying as much as he can-and he won’t quit
Come on. He can't. He's a bobble head in a suit who would be no where if not for his hair and last name. No experience, no  but he can follow a script. Perfect Manchurian candidate.
#WeVapeWeVote how awful .. @realDonaldTrump see what @NYGovCuomo did??? He should be ashamed 
It's too late for Trudeau. He didn't act until Premier's forced his hand, he rambles non answers to just about every ques asked without actually answering the ques. His health min just told us china is honest all along about virus & Tam broke every protocol for pandemics.
If MSM, including @FoxNews , wants Cuomo to be the Dem face of the crisis, he has some real ‘splaining to do. What happened to all that equipment, Governor?
Andrew Cuomo's EX is Fed Up With People 'Body Shaming' Him For Having Pierced Nipples We are fed up with him being  in the middle of a pandemic! De Blasio and Cuomo need to stop blaming @POTUS and look in the  …
Actually, it appears that all of these various predictive models (Climate Change & Pandemic) have two things  intentionally misleading; carefully designed to suggest conclusions that will elicit public fear and hysteria.

He can’t throw away the script because he’s an empty vessel.Incapable of empathy.
Why is calling people you disagree with "uneducated" the fallback of liberal halfwits? There are massively educated conservatives and many liberals who are dumb as a post, please retire that line.
Hey Dumpster, I need someone like you with a lot of followers. EVERYONE PLEASE TWEET THIS: Many people are saying Jared Kushner is an idiot.
I can’t and will not watch the President’s briefings anymore. I can’t take the defensive, condescending, and rude way he answers appropriate questions; I cringe at his boasting...I’m happy to listen to Anderson Cooper and the Cuomo brothers....Stay well, everybody!
Whatever, he needed to ditch his dearly held Canada killing carbon tax. He is putting the me in team Canada
Sorry, but I simply cannot support Dr Tam, the drama teacher & the graphic designer who allowed this train wreck to happen.
To me it looks like Ford has realized 1000’s will die during his term, he is wearing it. No one would want that job. Trudeau remains smug and glib while Canadians die, I think that’s the big difference
Yeah, it's pretty clear Trudeau is still relying on talking points. Painfully obvious in his non-answer answers to reporters questions. Plus, I know she's Health minister, but he REALLY needs to stop sending Hajdu (and Joly) out to do press conferences and interviews.
I have to add my voice to the other Chris. @NYCMayor this is not good for the kids or the teachers.
I am extremely sorry to read you’re unwell with symptoms of #COVID19. Frontline health workers and emergency responders, in fact any one with a conscience and a soul, should take priority for testing over sycophants.
Unfortunately he can't throw away the script and that's why he's in isolation day 23. He'd be exposed as an unqualified fraud if he had to think and speak on his feet
The reason why @fordnation and @NYGovCuomo are connecting is because they speak to people without artifice, without embellishment. @JustinTrudeau isn’t connecting because he still sounds like he’s reciting someone else’s words. He needs to throw away the damn script.
#NewYork deserves better @NYGovCuomo Everyone who smokes cigarettes deserves equal opportunities to give up their habit-a habit that kills 7 million annually. & everyone who has prioritized helping others give up their habit, deserves recognition-not loss of their livelihoods.  …
This is exactly it. @UFT utterly failed when it capitulated to Cuomo, telling its members to “think of nurses,” as if hosting classes on Zoom will provide PPE for nurses. And the mayor, in his endless power struggle with Cuomo, decided he’d do one better.
And there are MILLIONS MORE who have not been able to even file a claim because the website and phone lines are crashing! I am one of those people. @NYGovCuomo please fix the UI process for filing a claim! 24/7 filing and more people working the phones - please!
I will remember that the first time I see a kid with one of your Hale tobacco heating devices use government to  hypocrite
How can anyone be praising Cuomo? If you get on TV and make it look like you are fighting for the people that's good enough. Almost half the death's in the entire Nation are from NY. What the heck would a bad job look like?
1/2 @OneidaNatnNews so apparently @NYGovCuomo decided to ban #vape flavors by pulling a fast one similar to past fed & state actions concerning #Natives Make a stand & continue selling flavored e-liquids to promote a Public Health Win for the tribe and others #vapingsaveslives

Will somebody do me a favor and stick of ventilator up Cuomo's ass so he'll shut the f*ck up.
I'm trying to best deal with the anger I am experiencing, not only with Trump's  but more-so with his utter indifference to human lives. He seems gleeful about New Yorkers dying because he is jealous of Cuomo and we voted blue in 2016.
This is an outrage. What little respect you show to the hardworking NYC educators you claim to appreciate. I have never felt so embarrassed to be a part of the DOE @UFT @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo

Dear @NYCSchools @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo and @DOEChancellor how on Earth can you justify spending the 150k staff members you value SO MUCH to work for FREE for 7 days after literally reinventing education in 3 days?!? Educators have DIED and we are TIRED!
We would have a better unemployment situation if y'all listened to the  the libs lodged 6 weeks ago. This is happening because Donald Trump decided to listen to President Xi. Something hoax fake news something.
Another take on @NYCMayor’s poor decision making is he’s getting into a pissing context w/ @NYGovCuomo. Cuomo strips NYC public schools of spring break, so de Blasio strips them of 2 days of Passover. Teachers, school personnel, parents & kids need to catch their breath. #NYC
@NYGovCuomo I teach nonverbal children with autism in a 6:1:1 classrooom and my class is doing such a wonderful job in my google classroom! Their parents are proud and so am I! The mayor doesn’t appreciate us- show us you care! @UFT
@NYGovCuomo @NYCSpeakerCoJo how are you letting @NYCMayor take away the religious holidays of next week? Passover & Good Friday... I respect having to work over spring break, but show respect. @UFT @flattenthecurve
@NYCMayor @UFT @NYGovCuomo I cannot believe you’re taking away 2 holidays from educators who have worked so hard to support their students while having to care for their kids at home!! No appreciation nor respect for those in education!!

#Hannity @DrOz just said Governor’s STOP holding hydroxychloriquine @GovSisolak @NYGovCuomo Let Dr’s prescribe it to anyone THEY feel needs it. We have tons of it. Israel just sent 10 million doses! Big PHARMA is donating 130 doses. ENOUGH
People are literally dying in hospital begging for ventilators while Chris Cuomo is doing multiple interviews on CNN saying he had a bad night. What a drama queen.
Bloomberg and Cuomo turning New York into a huge graveyard. 
NY looses big money (taxes and MSA) if smokers quit by vaping. So it is not weird, it’s perverse! NY authorities know vaping is much safer than smoking , they are protecting their  not people’s life.
Glad to see @seanhannity SLAMMING @NYGovCuomo ! Well deserved!
Interesting that the union had no such outrage when @NYGovCuomo took a whole week away from us. We gave an inch with no pushback. The mayor saw that and knew he could take more.

Catholic group slams DeBlasio for questioning Christian charity's New York coronavirus field hospital. cc @nyGovCuomo  #FoxNews @nycmayor WHY ARE YOU DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CATHOLICS? YOU need all the hospitals, nurses, doctors YOU CAN GET YOU RACIST PIG
Trump tonight when asked about @nygovcuomo saying New York will soon run out of ventilators: "We happen to think that he is well served with ventilators. We're going to find out." Yes, I suppose we will.
3. Yet, Cuomo and the others are not condemned or challenged. The president is now having to try to fill the void left by Cuomo and other governors. So, why attack him, and why attack Kushner?
2. But the Left is both ignorant and obnoxious. Moreover, they dare not criticize Andrew Cuomo for FAILING to purchase ventilators over a period of many years, before the pandemic. Instead, he had other priorities, like solar panels.
And here's the thing. If @NYGovCuomo is right, and it turns out he did need the thousands of ventilators Trump isn't providing, Trump will never acknowledge that at any point he disagreed with Cuomo about what was needed  …
I should mention his brother @ChrisCuomo who is doing a sterling job, too, despite having succumbed to #Covid_19 himself.
Asked again about Kushner's statement about the federal stockpile not for use by the States: "We need the stockpile... "When the  it's gonna be big" Has he seen NY right now? And heard @NYGovCuomo pleading for ventilators because there is a desperate need.. NOW! 
9 years smoke free over here thanks to vaping. But hey, so what.
HOW DARE @NYGovCuomo criticize @realDonaldTrump for not getting him 30,000 #ventilators when 4,000 (!!!!) ventilators were found in storage and STILL not sent to the hospitals that need them!! Even the Democrats see through your pathetic games and don't want 
He hates NY because NY is no fan of #Trump. Plus he's so intensely jealous of @NYGovCuomo who's everything #POTUS is not, including Cuomo's mom & fam love him while Trump's mom clearly didn't like him. Justice? Use #TrumpTower for #coronavirus patients. #TrumpPressBriefing
He says "We happen to think [Gov. Cuomo] is well served with ventilators. We're gonna find out!" Meaning...we're gonna see if a lot of people die and then we'll know who's right.  …
. @JasonMillerinDC: It seemed as though #NYC #coronavirus numbers caught even @NYGovCuomo off guard today in press conference #WarRoomPandemic #CCPVirus #30DaysToSaveAmerica  
How much longer can this last without MASSIVE consequences
President Trump just said of @NYGovCuomo: "We happen to think he's well served with ventilators." Governor Cuomo said today: We do not have enough ventilators. Period.
. @jonkarl: Cuomo says NY may be days away from running out of ventilators. Can you assure NY that they will have the ventilators they need? TRUMP: "No. They should've had more ventilators at the time. They should've had more ventilators." 
Arrest or fine anyone that is out for no reason !!! Set ground rules so people actually will listen
How well we stay apart will directly impact the  of this pandemic. Social distancing saves lives. Spread the word. 
So he continues to deny a problem in NY. And "our" national ventilators are headed to other states he likes better. And it's Cuomo's fault. I have so many thoughts. So many. The one I'll state here: It's the President's fault. His responsibility. Whether he "takes" it or not.
The world doesn't revolve around NY, the rest of us don't want to watch Gov. Andy.
Let's be clear - @NYGovCuomo is solely responsible for the lack of ventilators in New York -- not @realDonaldTrump
Dear @NYGovCuomo , shame on you willing to let Americans die because of your hate for the second amendment. Stay woke.  …
Trump is going to regret telling New Yorkers and @NYGovCuomo: "We happen to think he's well served with ventilators but we're gonna find out" "We're gonna find out" means a lot of people could die because of shortages.
HELP @NYGovCuomo  …
I'm in Scotland and I know that if I want to have truthful information about what is going on in, at least, one state in the USA, I listen to what @NYGovCuomo has to say. If I want bad  I listen to what the orange manbaby has to say.
It is unconscionable that in the United States of America the States have  for lifesaving equipment and personnel and the president has favorite Repub states he helps.

TY @NYGovCuomo for passing the SAFE act in 2013. Keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers is essential to protecting the lives of women, abused partners & children. These terrifying situations are much more lethal with firearms in the home @MomsDemand  …
Inspiring. Folks who don’t like “government” or “politicians”, take a look at this. @NYGovCuomo  …

This tweet from Bill De Blasio is very dangerous. This stupid moronic idiot dumb f**king Mayor is telling New York City to go see a movie. This guy is sick. @NYGovCuomo don’t you  when you don’t have enough medical supplies. You and the NYC Mayor are idiots.  …

Thank you County Leader Keith L.T. Wright. As a Manhattan District Leader I strongly support this! “ @ManhattanDems calls on NYS—either through legislative action or executive order of @NYGovCuomo —to end all petition challenges for the 2020 election cycle..”  …
"And like Viktor Orban on the Hudson, @NYGovCuomo wanted to use the pandemic to arrogate vast new powers to himself: the ability to further slash spending on a quarterly basis without so much as consulting the democratically elected legislature."  …
Hey @NYCMayor -- When you are done with your workout, can you please call this person? Not sure if you've been watching @NYGovCuomo's briefings but there's a health crisis in the city.  …
Oh, please—there is a way & @NYGovCuomo knows it: #ClemencyNow #LetThemGo. He's just scared he'll risk his political career. But his legacy will be deadly if he fails to 
Imagine if @realDonaldTrump sent the army into Mexico or Canada to take privately owned ventilators out of nursing homes. The press & the left would lose their minds. @NYGovCuomo is doing exactly that except he is doing it to citizens of his state with the virus expanding upstate
Members of  are dying in growing numbers. We need more ventilators NOW to meet the need. We are also mindful that @NYGovCuomo signed a state budget today to cut Medicaid. Terrible always. Unconscionable today.  …
Any physician, nurse or healthcare worker who dies from treating Covid patients should be given the option to be buried in Arlington cemetery and honored as a wartime hero @VP @NYGovCuomo @POTUS

Of course you do. You both really like to tell everyone else how to live.
People with health issues who use e-cigs may have an increased risk  with #COVID19 – making the fight to end the sale of flavored e-cigs more urgent than ever. I applaud @nygovcuomo & state leaders for banning the sale of all flavored e-cigs.
