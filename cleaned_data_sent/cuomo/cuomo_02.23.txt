 from 9/11 experience: This is life and death. Coronavirus response should be above politics I congratulate VP Pence and Gov. Cuomo for setting the right example. Working together,and cutting through the red tape,the VP Task Force approved NY’s test.
It’s about time! @NYGovCuomo Many of us #Scientists involved in #SciComm #RiskComm on #COVID19 have been saying the only way to get a good grasp of the underlying prevalence is to test widely. Data is critical for informing #PubHealth measures. See   …
I think it would be wise to set up mobile test units to go into neighborhoods throughout the city for free testing if possible. Many will not go to the Hospital.
Allowing judges to predict “dangerousness” & detain legally innocent people before trial would cause direct harm to Black, Brown &  people. Tell @NYGovCuomo @NYSenDems @NYSenateDems that we won’t return to a broken pretrial system:  
NYS health officials will start testing suspected cases of coronavirus at a laboratory in Albany, a move they say will result in faster results, @NYGovCuomo announced. As of Saturday, 28 people in NY have been tested. 27 of the tests have been negative; one is still pending.
Good thing @VP isn't governor of Indiana anymore because we know he wouldn't approve  sense health policies if he was.
It wasn't people at the CDC. The test development was contracted out. Private business was making the screwed up test.
BREAKING: When I spoke to @VP, I urged him to approve New York State’s #coronavirus test — we just received word that our test has been approved by the FDA. This will expedite wait time and improve NY’s ability to more effectively manage the coronavirus situation as it unfolds.

Let me get this straight. When @NYGovCuomo calls for curbing the growth in state Medicaid spending it’s NOT a cut. When Trump admin does not renew a waiver request it’s a devastating cut to Medicaid.
“what does it mean, ‘let’s do marijuana’” – @NYGovCuomo
The Executive Budget from @NYGovCuomo allocates almost $100 million less than what's needed cover CUNY's operating cost. This underfunding plus the $79 million TAP Gap means CUNY can't offer the courses that students need.

Tell Pelosi to tell Richie Neal of @WaysMeansCmte to demand Trump’s NY tax returns! @NYGovCuomo signed a new law permitting it last year, but @HouseDemocrats pretended they didn’t want to overreach and harm impeachment.
Let's educate the public shall we? . @NYGovCuomo wants to ban flavored vapor products and other crazy regulations that would basicly kill the industry here in NY. He's using the "save the kids" tactic. Studies already debunked that argument. Look how little of the money is used.

They ban flavoured #vaping products then legalise marijuana, what do you think youths are going to use now, @ParentsvsVape @NYGovCuomo, but that's ok as long as you get your cut, it's never been about protecting youth, it's always been about protecting the money #vapingsaveslives
Enjoy your last term,

I’m almost 100% that when Lying @NYGovCuomo said that people put Castor Oil in their vapes, he knew most people over 40 would think it was the old-wives’ snake-oil, and people under 40 would think its Castrol GTX motor oil. #quitlying #youLIEpeopleDIE #vapingsaveslives

We often mix Politicians, as a public service product, with carrier oils - many of the oils have been found to be dangerous, cash money among them, quid pro quo is another they use to carry the palm grease...

Cuomo’s next bid in Trusted Traveler fight with Trump  
I can't explain fiction with a straight face.
Illegal immigrants already broke laws, genius.
If they told the truth they wouldn't be able be able to tax vaping at the same rate as cigarettes, the game would be up.
