In response to 2500 illnesses and 56 deaths caused by adulterated bootleg THC (cannabis) vape cartridges, US federal and local governments are contemplating massive taxes and bans on nicotine vaping products that have helped over 3 million Americans quit smoking. It's that dumb.

I would guess that at least 80% of the general public don't know the difference between nicotine vapes and THC vapes.
Illicit street THC carts cause over 2500 illnesses and 56 deaths. Gov't decides ban more safe products so people can buy deadly products from dealers. I think this may be their way of population control. That's the New theory I'm working on.

You admitted vaping was safer than smoking @NYGovCuomo but still want to ban it, how does this make sense? This is just another tactic of yours to try to control the people of NYS, but we will fight back & we will fight for our rights You will not take anymore of our rights away.
Meanwhile @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor try to cover the story up of blacks, especially those entranced by Farrakhan, attacking Jews b/c it doesn't fit their narrative. The #Democrats are trying very hard to cover this up.
A recent clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that e-cigarettes were twice as effective as traditional nicotine replacement products such as nicotine gum or the patch. Why would someone want to ban such an effective tool. TOTALLY CRAZY
WHY...... 
Sole purpose for the bans is, to protect his MSA money, bans will only send people to the black market, some of them are probably youth/teen vapers, totally ignoring what the CDC has now confirmed, lung illnesses not caused traditional nicotine vaping, he shouldn't be in office.

Here’s why @NYGovCuomo #vaping policy would be a gift to big tobacco. -Flavor ban means not enough products for vape shops to survive -Online ban means no access to hardware or eliquid Only thing left is vape devices in convenience stores. Almost all owned by big tobacco.

@NYGovCuomo This is what Jewish people have to face in NYC while your police do nothing. This is hate speech & she should have been immediately arrested & removed from the area, but your police allowed it to happen & she's out there doing it to others. You promote the hate.
It is already proven you can't control a black market so you creat a new one. Absurd. Guess what the black market doesn't care about the age of people you have saved no one.... But so what right 
"Intentionally targeting young people" would require insane business sense and improbable evil. This lie assumes  considered 34 million adult smokers willing to pay $200/month and decided instead to target illegal teens on allowances. It doesn't pass a laugh test.

"I want this state to be the first state to have a domestic terrorism law to express how ignorant this is, how intolerant it is and how criminal it is," says @NYGovCuomo.  …
Jews from New York to @NYGovCuomo, @NYCMayor: We are sick & tired of the tweets condemning antisemitism, we don’t need tweets & press conferences. Talk is cheap, we need action & we need it 
"I do not tolerate this" - says the guy who has done nothing but tolerate Antisemitic attacks across his state for months...
"Thoughts and prayers aren't enough. We're going to increase security at vulnerable sites. And we have to call this what it is: domestic terrorism, targeting people because they are Jewish. They were celebrating Channukah, 2 are still hospitalized, one in critical." - @NYGovCuomo  …
The man accused of attacking people with a machete last night at a Hanukkah celebration—an act @NYGovCuomo called #Antisemitism and domestic terror—has plead not guilty to 5 counts of attempted murder and 1 of burglary. 
. @NYGovCuomo, you can call this whatever you want. It's not domestic terrorism. There's no political aim here that's at least public. It's just antisemitism. Calling it anything else is antisemitic. It belittles the only reason this happened... Because they were Jews.  …
Where is @NYGovCuomo and @BilldeBlasio on this case, in 
You obviously tolerate it. Some might say you encourage it! Your new bail reform scheme is about to release these criminals back onto our streets to terrorize  All while you have passed laws to prevent us from protecting ourselves!
As @NYGovCuomo projects, seems like a good time to remind everyone ths HATRED against Jews is fueled by Dem support of BDS & mbrs of Congress. Thy empower aggressors by decriminalizing offenses & strap police! NY lets these ‘Terrorist’ OUT BOND FREE! 
Lets be clear, Cuomo's Bail Reform scheme is about to release more of these terrorisre back into  More blood will be on Cuomo's hands! Your words of solidarity are cheap when your actions enable terrorism.
Tiffany Harris arrested after her spree of EIGHT anti-Semitic attacks on Jews - thn quickly released in2 neighborhood she terrorized thx to “bail reform” legislation @NewYorkStateAG & @NYGovCuomo stand w/ criminals- NOT law abiding citizens of NY!  …
Someone please inform @NYGovCuomo that the hatred he describes is not country wide but more prevalent in large Democratic run cities. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica  … #NewsandPolitics via @pjmedia_com
So after months of @NYGovCuomo allowing the demonization & witch hunts of Hasidic Jews over measles, hate crimes are up. 2+2. Are the Amish next? THINK.
Hmm. Why does this not read a black person stabbed a bunch of Jewish white ppl lighting the candles for their holiday!? New York is failing under #deblasio @NYGovCuomo maybe the new #freddo with this debacle #NewYork  …
Yet another attack on the  on the heels of our heartbreaking losses in Jersey City this month. We stand in solidarity with the residents of @NYGov and @NYGovCuomo in  to protecting our  as the victims of this horrible crime heal.
Sunday December 29, 2019. @NYGovCuomo STILL has not granted clemency to anyone in 2019.  …
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the  across NY in condemning this flagrant act of anti-Semitism. @NYGovCuomo is right: this is domestic terrorism. To our Jewish siblings, we love you, we grieve w/ you, we will fight for you.  …
If you’re serious you’ll immediately suspend full implementation if the horribly misguided bail reform act and create a bi-partisan bill with which to replace it.
The blood is on @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo hands.
As a Rocklander, I’m relieved that @NYGovCuomo immediately came to Rockland to firmly say that anti-semitism will never have a place in New York State- especially under his watch. Very scary times.  …
An Iowa man was recently sentenced to 16 years in prison for the hate crime of stealing and burning a gay pride flag. Our system of law, order and “justice” is going to disintegrate into chaos unless it starts to deliver justice that is a lot more equal. @realDonaldTrump
Can’t you see where the governor’s going with this... he’s not trying to fix the problem he’s playing politics with it...He’s trying to blame us “the deplorable‘s and @realDonaldTrump “ good luck 

THIS is the kind of state @NewYorkStateAG & @NYGovCuomo are running. They give priority to illegals. Full stop. If you live in NY & DO NOT vote these democrats OUT that are passing policy that out citizens in danger?? You’ll get what you deserve. VOTE DEMS OUT  …
It is critical that @NewYorkStateAG James and @NYGovCuomo have immediately called the #Monsey attack an act of domestic terrorism and Cuomo spoke about the "cancer" in our national discourse--and we all know the nexus of that because we read the tweets every morning.
These attacks are happening in States that dont honor #2A! It’s populace is disarmed! This Jew right here lives in Florida and should you try to harm me or my family, I wont lay down and die without a fight! @NYGovCuomo’s policies are the cancer! 
How can @NYGovCuomo & @NYCMayor be believed as heartfelt when they open their door to illegal aliens, M13 gang members & potential terrorists, harboring them in their state? They don't give a RIP about NY citizens and what happens to them.  #FoxNews
. @NYGovCuomo It’s time to allow concealed carry in NYC. People being beaten, stabbed, shot to death. They have no means of defense. You won’t protect these people. Please allow them to protect themselves. You have armed security. OR Is your life worth more than theirs?
You bemoan the rise of #AntiSemitism yet it's your  who are responsible for it @NYGovCuomo. #Hypocrite Cuomo calls machete attack during Hanukkah celebration an 'act of terrorism' as other politicians react  …
A guy burns an LGBTQ flag (granted he did steal it,  on, please) and gets 16 years and this freak gets a walk? What does this say about the values of our country?
I agree with @NYGovCuomo on this issue. We must stop all enemies - foreign and domestic. We must stand with the Jewish people.  …
NY has lost it! @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo how do you allow these CRIMINALS on the street without bail. They already admitted they broke the law? Stop helping the crooks! Anti-Semitic pieces of trash!
But it is your policies, endorsed by your signature, that will make/makes these events more prevalent.
. @NYGovCuomo held a dirty secret today. He forgot to mention that his new crime reform policies will release domestic .terrorists on a promise to return to appear. Not a joke. Policies take affect in Jan 1. Liberals hug everything evil.
Why any NY Jews would continue to donate to @NYGovCuomo or @BilldeBlasio baffles me. NY Jews better start #VOTINGFORREPUBLICANS if they want to save themselves & great state of NY
If the Attorney General of Sanctuary City New York, @NewYorkStateAG, wasn’t so eat up with TDS, she might be able to DO HER DAMN JOB & stop these lunatic democrats from all the heinous HATE crimes upon innocent ppl! FIX YOUR COMPLETELY SCREWED UP STATE LADY! @NYGovCuomo  …
Is @NYGovCuomo really this foolish to think  is dumb enough to accept this? You passed a bill not just a few weeks ago that will allow this piece of garbage to go free w/o bail on Jan 1st. How about you allow NY citizens to defend THEMSELVES, & not rely on govt!  …
 agree with @NYGovCuomo, this was an act of domestic terrorism, and our criminal code must reflect that.  …
With all due respect @NYGovCuomo - I don’t care what you call it. If 95% of the perpetrators are released hours after  attacks, it’ll keep happening. Until you show Jewish New Yorkers that you have our backs - not with words, but with actions, how can we feel safe?  …
Rabbi Rottenberg was not attacked. Five Orthodox Jews in the rabbi's home were attacked while celebrating Hanukkah. @NYGovCuomo met with the rabbi this morning. Why is @IvankaTrump in the White House, and how does she have a security clearance?  …  
UPDATE: The suspect in Saturday's Hannukah attack in Monsey, New York has been charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. Monsey Police identified the suspect as Grafton E. Thomas of Greenwood Lake, New 
. @NYGovCuomo should speak less at this press conference and let law enforcement speak more. They're right in calling out this so-called #BailReform as a dangerous step backward. Kudos to the officer for doing it in the presence of the Governor!
. @NYGovCuomo’s tail is stuck in the uh-oh cage. Rockland Co. sheriff says bail reforms have gone too far, will allow people charged with hate crimes to be released without bail. Libs want it both ways. They want to name hate crimes but only to pin them on the right. And @POTUS
I challenge elected officials to #walkaday with pef members -we would  you at any state agencies but especially into our facilities within OMH, DOCCS, OPWDD or OCFS to see the impact of a decade of cuts and poor policy decisions @CarlHeastie @AndreaSCousins @NYGovCuomo  …
I agree. We Americans isn't the problem. Illegal immigration is the problem. We Trump supporters should have protection against attacks. Even President Trump should be protected as well.
“We have to change the laws to call this what it is. This is terrorism. It is domestic terrorism.” @NYGovCuomo announced he would propose legislation that would make New York the first state with a domestic terrorism law 
Jewish neighborhoods in New York should be allowed to carry firearms. Cuomo and de Blasio need to step up immediately and fix this
Thank you @NYGovCuomo for your quick response and directing the State Police hate crimes task force to investigate. This despicable and horrific act was domestic terrorism. Thank you to law enforcement and members of the  for rallying together against hate.  …
“If anyone thinks that something poisonous is not going on in this country, then they’re in denial, frankly.” @NYGovCuomo calls hate "an American cancer spreading in the body politic” after a stabbing attack that wounded 5 people during Hannukah celebrations Saturday 
LOOK: Police in Harlem detain a suspect early on December 29 in connection with a knife attack at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, New York the night before. The attacker stabbed and wounded 5 people as they were lighting candles for Hanukkah, officials 
You noticed how he made it sound like Trump's fault....?
Right now here in Monsey @NYGovCuomo quotes an inscription at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem: “‘A country is not just what it does—it is also what it tolerates.’ Government will step up its efforts to protect the  
@NYGovCuomo call it for what it is, it was Antisemitism!! No and, ifs or buts about it! Face the facts!
You are evil and sickening @NYGovCuomo
@NYGovCuomo So now that you caught the demon, what will you do? #Antisemitism #HateCrime #DomesticTerrorism #RocklandCounty #Monsey #NewYork @NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio @realDonaldTrump  
Hey @NYGovCuomo, how about hate attacks against @realDonaldTrump supporters? We're not the problem, nor do we "have  Where's the tolerance for us? Also, you speak of illegality while simultaneously excusing "immigration status": illegal aliens got here ILLEGALLY!
Right after Cuomo proposes a new Domestic Terrorism law in NY, Rockland County Sheriff called out @NYGovCuomo, the @NYSenateDems and @NYSA_Majority for the bail reforms passed, which includes release of someone without bail for a terrorist threat. You can’t have it both ways.
Think of @NYGovCuomo as a slightly better street fighter than @GavinNewsom. It's a family hegemony business. Well rehearsed and well practiced with clear ratlines in place.
Amazing how much @NYGovCuomo is avoiding talking about the policies he signed into law to avoid taking any political backlash from the criminal assaults against Jews that have happened in NY in recent days/weeks
. @NYGovCuomo is irresponsible in his attempts to blame “the country” & anyone other than the violent perpetrator. Disgusting. It’s not his place to talk for the country. He’s a lowly racist governor. STFU! #Antisemitism #hanukkahparty #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #VoteRed
This is the 2nd such attack on Jews in Monsey, and the 3rd in #NYC metro area this month! We must all unite against #Antisemitism and NOT tolerate violence of any kind. Understand this: an attack against innocent, defenseless people, is an attack against us ALL! @NYGovCuomo  …
Next to @NYGovCuomo, Rockland Co. sheriff says bail reforms have gone too far, will allow people charged with hate crimes to be released without bail.
Only a leftist POS could turn a terrorist with a F**ING MACHETE attacking Jewish people celebrating Hanukkah into a political issue. CUOMO is garbage 
So @NYGovCuomo of New York is saying that the recent attacks on the  is an act of #DomesticTerrorism yet he signed the law releasing these terrorists without bail because it is cruel. Hmmm @SaraCarterDC @ffweekend @marklevinshow @charliekirk11 @RepLeeZeldin
President @realDonaldTrump warned @NYGovCuomo and @BilldeBlasio not to release these 
Happening ASAP: @NYGovCuomo holds briefing with Jewish Faith Leaders and local officials at Ramapo Following last night’s horrific Anti-Semitic Attack in Monsey. Watch here: 
My heart is broken. Again. Sending love & light and standing with @NYGovCuomo & the entire  against domestic terrorism.  …
In front of the Monsey, NY residence of a Hasidic rabbi where multiple stabbings took place last evening during a Hanukkah celebration, @NYGovCuomo consoles family and declares the attack “an act of domestic terror.” 
Walking to the press microphones to declare this “an act of domestic terror” is @NYGovCuomo,  by @YossiGestetner, outside the Monsey, NY residence of a Hasidic rabbi, where five people were stabbed last 
. @NYGovCuomo: “I consider this an act of domestic terrorism.” 
What a joke! You and Deblasio are the ones protecting the  these attacks! No bail and free Mets tickets?? This is lunacy you should be ashamed of yourself!
#BailReformNewYork Soon hundreds of criminals will be released in my suburb of NY to PREY on my neighbors, children, elderly, EVERYDAY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS! These criminals can return to the scene of the crime to the house they attacked someone in, robbed, sexually assaulted!
How’s that white Supremacist task force working out? Catching all those white supremacists, @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo ?  …
Honest question: What the hell is going on in New York City when Jewish citizens can't even walk down the street without getting attacked?!? And what are leaders doing about it?!? #Monsey @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo
We are shocked and appalled by the stabbing of 5  members in New York last night. This unacceptable act of violent anti-semitism must be renounced by all and we call on all our public officials to do more to protect our Jewish Communities @NYGovCuomo  …
It’s easy to blame Trump instead of policies of the state, governor and mayor. Never mind the hate from Omar and Talib. But yea, Trumps fault. How ludicrous
. @NYGovCuomo , you signed own warrant ending your career. You are a special kind of fool, as an atty & politician, to believe these bail reforms wouldn’t blow back on you. Going to enjoy watching your career implode & end. Pray people protect themselves.  …
No joke at all @HikindDov  you for being the ONLY one to speak the truth and not being shy about it. We need to have laws that allow open carry. These antisemites need to know that if they attack us they will be met with cold hard metal. #FightBack
Stop voting for Democrats like de Blasio & Cuomo. They do not seem to care about Jewish Americans and their safety. New laws in NY state are unhelpful too. Violent people are let back on the street right away. How is that good for 
Jews in New York are sick and tired of the tweets condemning antisemitism, we don’t need tweets, we don’t need press conferences, we need action and we need it now! CC: @NYGovCuomo, 
Ditto! @BilldeBlasio and @NYGovCuomo have blood of innocent Hasidic Jews and Christians on their hands!  …
It is now @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @AOC @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo #America! #DemocRats refused to condemn #antisemitism in the Congress, now it is open season to attack #Jews on daily basis. #WakeUpAmerica #uspolitics #Monsey
If you catch the perps they will be released with gift cards and Mets tickets to continue their reign of terror with impunity.
Thanks for your new bail reform law, we feel much safer 
And thanks to the changes you've made to the criminal justice system in New York, you really can't do much about it. Congratulations.
Things are about to get UGLIER REAL FAST! @NYGovCuomo This WILL backfire worse on you BIG TIME. It will be personal to you & you will have to watch the perp WALTZ OUT at your ridiculous, non-existent laws. HT:  …
Thanks to @NYGovCuomo, once the attacker is apprehended they can do two things. 1) Be released from jail on no bail 2) Allowed to reenter the home of the attack, to confront their accusers. "Multiple people wounded at rabbi's home in Monsey"  …
How about that bail reform?
fullest extent of the law = "catch'n release"
Thanks to your bail reform laws, there are going to be many, many more of these attacks. You have destroyed New York.
But, but @NYGovCuomo said he has “zero tolerance for anti-Semitism in NY & will hold those accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” He forgot to mention the law was garbage and they weren’t going to hold anyone.
Horrified by the news of the multiple stabbing at a Monsey synagogue tonight. France stands in solidarity with the people of Rockland county and the  Antisemitism has no place in our democraties. @NYGovCuomo @ADL_NYNJ
Statement from @NYGovCuomo on #Monsey Stabbing: "I am directing the State Police hate crimes task force to immediately investigate and to use every tool available. State Police are currently on the scene."
Cuomo’s response to hate crimes: bail reform. Total failure.
. @NYGovCuomo in statement: “This was a despicable and cowardly act, and I am directing the State Police hate crimes task force to immediately investigate and to use every tool available to hold the attacker accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” 
Zero tolerance and Zero action to prevent future attacks
I am horrified by the stabbing of multiple people at a synagogue in Rockland County tonight. We have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism in NY and we will hold the attacker accountable to the fullest extent of the law. NY stands with the 
Tonight's FUCK YOU goes out to @NYGovCuomo for the cruel bill barring my doc from re-prescribing 12 narcotic pills/year for me because I take Valium. I'M IN TEARS from this #pain & none of the pharmacies have had the replacement Rx for a MONTH.
He’s correct. This state is a dumpster fire caused by @NYGovCuomo and @NewYorkStateAG
Hey @BernieSanders @AOC @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio  about the rampant anti-Semitism and antisemtic attacks of Jews in NYC and NY State every day this channuka?? @AOC when the Pittsburgh shooting happened, you tweeted right away that white supramacy is a cancer.
Not likely to get any help from either. They created this current situation.
You signed the wretched paper into law so that we can have criminals like this go without posted bail. #notmygovernor #cuomoout

Are you disgusted to learn that one of perpetrators of the attacks was arrested and released NO BAI thanks to the criminal "reform" bill YOU SIGNED INTO LAW.
This man doesn’t know the first thing about leadership. The money New York State is using to protect his properties should be used  homelessness. Let Trump Organization pay for their own security. They were doing it before. @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @SenSchumer
In their lust for power, Democrats are willing to let criminal migrants assault and murder American citizens. Shame shame shame.
Loser state. Them with California. All Democratic states @NYGovCuomo  …
. @NYGovCuomo said “SO WHAT” to tobacco harm reduction products that can help smokers make that life changing switch away from cigarettes. He doesn’t care about the health & well-being of adult smokers & vapers who are ex-smokers.
I just got off at my stop and the next train is 18 minutes away. This is shameful.
@NYGovCuomo Thank you for this! You are destroying our state more & more each day.
Hello- can you share a four-digit car number from the train? ^JTG
Apparently the reason this downtown Q train is so packed is that it's the first one in 40 minutes. On a Saturday night. That serves 20+ stops that no other train serves. What the fuck @NYCTSubway? What the fuck @NYGovCuomo
OMG...Seeing Trump attack New York, NY Prosecutors & Governor Cuomo all in one tweet makes me think & hope some YUGE news is gonna drop soon. Maybe finally we'll get good news from SDNY or NY AG Tish James or NY DA Cy Vance Let it be PLEEEEEASE And let there be indictments 
As a NYer, let me remind you: majority of NY voted for @HillaryClinton and @NYGovCuomo. We don't like you.
True I feel as New Yorkers we are doomed to never travel East/West easily!
Thanks @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo !  …
Sadly, you’re probably correct
@NYGovCuomo needs to be removed!!! He’s destroying NY!!
Apparently Trump wants America to no longer include New York State. Frankly I hope @NYGovCuomo takes him up on it. I'd be happy if my tax dollars went to New York instead supplementing Kentucky.  …
Disgusted? You should be disgusted when you look in the mirror
Thankful for the @NYGovCuomo on this issue. Antisemitism is not  in NYS.
United against all hate!

@RudyGiuliani hate to tell you this but the residual Mafioso is still around. They are DiNiro, Cuomo, Biden Pelosi/D’Allessandro, DiBlasio, Schumer WB(nameless)EC. @realDonaldTrump
Wow, this is almost as illuminating as your 6 page letter to Speaker Pelosi. Talk about projecting, Governor Cuomo has lost his mind?? No, he doesn't spend his days rage tweeting, obsessing about others, feeling persecuted, imaging enemies, etc.. NY state is just fine.
NYC to ITH in an hour? I support that. #highspeedrail
How much will taxes go up when Cuomo requires training, helmets, blinkers, and seat belts?
Like Chris Cuomo has pointed out trump can call him whatever he wants from afar but he would never say anything to his face. Typical bully. No balls and run when confronted. Captain Bone Spurs.
Trump Says New York Officials Investigating Him ‘Makes Me Hate’ NY: ‘Cuomo Has Lost Control’  …
“So sad to see that New York City and State are falling apart. All they want to do is investigate to make me hate them even more than I should. Cuomo has lost control, and lost his mind. Very bad for the homeless and all!” Trump said Saturday afternoon.
