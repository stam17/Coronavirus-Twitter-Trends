Refusing to subsidize or regulate luxury ingredients is not oppression. Demanding regulation or subsidies for luxury ingredients is decadence. No taxes for menstrual products? Good. Regulations to make melon extracts in shaving cream more accessible? Bad.
It costs more to buy because it costs more to make. Manufacturers produce what people buy. Products that do not sell are pulled from shelves. These more expensive products are on the shelves because women refuse to buy bland products even if they are marketed to women.
Compare a can of women’s shaving cream to men’s. You’ll notice that the products for women have a variety of more exotic extracts, exfoliants, and other ingredients. Such ingredients cost more per fluid ounce than what are in men’s products. Costs are passed onto consumers.

On the way to another lobby day in Albany to again try and #SaveCDPA from the attacks of @NYGovCuomo and his attempts to save money on disabled people's freedom. Really getting tired of it. Wish New Yorkers would #CripTheVote and get us a new Governor.
Agree passionately & wholeheartedly with @NYGovCuomo  …
@bernieandsid just made a great point: Important to remember as we grapple with attempted assaination of NYPD officers over the weekend, @NYGovCuomo patrolled Herman Bell who assassinated 2 cops in NY. Then Cuomo gave conditional pardon which let him vote  …
Hey @NYGovCuomo and @GovLarryHogan, do you guys have #FriendsInChina? I bet you were nervous after @SecPompeo made this speech! #TickTock! #TrustKansas! #Justice!  
@POTUS @GavinNewsom @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio What say all you liberal politicians walking your own law enforcement into death traps? Your lawless sanctuaries are only going to cause the American people to rise up against your evil and wicked ways.

Hey Governor of NY- Better make a statement @NYGovCuomo  …
NYC is under siege by @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo. Pray for New York City.
The city isn't burning down chicken little. You're talkin about New York City! Remember 9/11? Yeah. Keep your panties untwisted.
Blame the idiots who voted them in more then once
You should be REMOVED from office immediately! It is YOUR LAWLESS policies that have caused all of this! Shame on you and @NYGovCuomo ! You are 
They have no clue what to do since their prime focus is trying to stay in office. They need to leave.
EXACTLY! They both need to leave office and NY. They have ruined NY since taking office.
The pot calling the kettle black. You just mixed up 2 economists. This has nothing to do with @NRA & everything to do with bad public policy enacted by @NYGovCuomo #NYSafeAct #BailReform. Your #NewWayForwardAct is also policy that do not support law enforcement + opens  …
dude what the city isn't burning at all, lots of people live here and it's awesome
The left's agenda aides and abets criminals while endangering peace officers and law abiding citizens. #NYPD
This is some chaotic failed-state type of announcement. Is it a threat of violence? Is it a threat of a coup? Is the mayor safe? Is anyone? Should @NYGovCuomo be sending in State police to secure the NYPD? Someone from NYC government needs to clarify ASAP. 
THEY HATE YOU. Their blood is on your hands and @NYGovCuomo 
I still say all injured or killed, SUE NY, SUE CUOMO, SUE DEBLASIO, their insane laws are not working in NY what don’t they get @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio
The epidemic where no-one dies.
The Trusted Traveler/NEXUS Programs for travel between the US and Canada is a key reason why WNY has a bi-national economy. I join @NYGovCuomo in calling on the president to rescind this decision and demand @TomReedCongress to join us, not encourage it.  
It is clear the #Killings at the @NYCACC & other #NY Pounds won't stop because of @NYGovCuomo or the #GroundHogSlayer @BilldeBlasio taking action. It is up to us & a few political allies to stop more BUKOs from being butchered.  …
Shame on you and @NYGovCuomo for creating this.

Resign in shame , you weasel.
Given accelerating climate horrors it's just wild that the @MTA bus  with no additional funding from @NYGovCuomo for more frequent service. The governor should be writing the MTA a check in whatever amount they need to run 8m or even 5m headways across the city.
Healing prayers for two of our Officers, @NYPD41Pct, who were shot. These shootings were attempted assassinations of our Officers. One POS felon in custody who better never see freedom again. ~M @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio #RepealNoBailNY #NoBailFAIL  …
At today’s main NGA session, @SpeakerPelosi says her children take an “e pluribus unum” view of politics. @NYGovCuomo’s eyes light up. Background:  
You mean, "Grateful for creating a false epidemic," as there has never been a youth epidemic; only some kids experimenting as they always have and always will. Wish you rich, bored housewives would find a new hobby, instead of trying to make people go back to deadly cigarettes.

NYC takes the lead! Now NYS and @NYGovCuomo must follow-stop ALL fossil fuel infrastructure, dismantle projects in progress. @riseandresistny @NYCDSA_Climate @SierraClubNYC @sunrisemvmtnyc @SaneEnergy  …
I live in NYC and because of @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo and their crooked lies, this once beautiful city is in absolute ruins. It's because of what they continue to do to law abiding citizens & your great leadership, that I have gratefully made the switch! They need to be stopped!!
He can’t condemn them. Those are his base voters. Surprised he wasn’t alongside them protesting. Our governor is one big phony and he owns this bail reform law. He has blood on his hands already and more 
And NYS needs to get a new governor who cares about his citizens and not just criminals and illegals
It’s open season on New York City police officers because of the dangerous pro criminal laws of @BilldeBlasio and @NYGovCuomo Andrew Cuomo @SBANYPD @NYPDShea @NYPDChiefofDept #BailReform 
The war on cops is real. If NYPD isn’t safe, no one is. It’s open season on law & order. This is the direct result of @BilldeBlasio, @NYGovCuomo, some radical City Council members and a State Legislature set on making life easier for criminals and harder for law abiding citizens.  …
This is what is is wrong with our government... @NYGovCuomo will meet with the opposition and those that are not knowledgeable about vaping but will not meet with @NYSVaporAssoc or others in the industry. Fully one sided. #MsaBloodMoney #FlavorsSaveLives

NY is the only state that restricts CBP to check their DMV data base to look at criminality! We can not vet a person for trusted traveler program without it. Why is @NYGovCuomo trying to protect ILLEGAL criminal immigrants?!! who the hell thinks this is a good idea?
You can’t have it both ways. I cannot support you if you continue to promote these dangerous and unsafe laws that do not protect witnesses & their families. Do you believe any witness  forward now ? You have given thugs a pass to run wild @SenSchumer @NYCMayor @NYPDShea 
We are still waiting for your tweet condemning the disrespectful and divisive anti-police protest that took over the subway system last week, @NYGovCuomo.  …
Great Job Bail Reform works well The hell with you and @NYCMayor
It’s your fault this is happening to our LEO’s and citizens of the NY! YOUR fault and only YOU.
Go deeper...why do the leaders of NY want to disarm their law-abiding citizens & expose them to dangerous thugs?! Why do they want to give these soulless villains free reign to bring destruction & chaos to NY?! Motives?! @realDonaldTrump @OANN
Horrified by the lack of leadership in City Hall and Albany.
You don't care at all. LIAR!!!!
“Horrified.” As if this wasn’t predictable when you pass criminal justice reform that emboldens the criminals to do their deeds. It’s only a matter of time before NY residents start dishing out their own criminal justice instead of praying the crippled justice system does its job
What did you think was going to happen after people were chanting f the police? It's history repeating itself and all you can do is tweet. How many more officers need to get hurt or killed before you allow them to do their job and stop tying their hands?
Hollow words unless you fix the "bail reform" and "discovery reform" disaster. Even the creators of NJ's laws think NY's laws are  …
Fullest extent of what law? The “one party state” encourages lawlessness.
@NYCMayor @SBANYPD @NYScanner Well done Andy & 
New Yorkers wake up and vote the Dems out before it’s too late. Or is it already to late.
Will he be released without bail because he cant afford it #BailReform Fail or are you gonna blame @realDonaldTrump on it ? Crime has increased due to this failed Bail Reform now Police Lives are at risk because of this too ??
@POTUS @NYGovCuomo and @NewYorkStateAG are both playing with fire. California and New York both better get off their little Power Trip and stop trying to dictate the drum beat of our Federal Government and the Trump Administration. (continued on Disqus)  
Instead of you and @NYCMayor worrying about climate change and Puerto Rico maybe it’s time you start worrying about what is going on in NY. Crime is up and all you care about is protecting the rights of these thugs #worstgovernorever #worstmayorever #democrartstheenemywithin
So you and de blasio will turn yourselves in. It's both your policies causing this.
Do the cop shooters get Season Passes now for shooting cops?? It’s your party that coddle criminals
Right after you give them an appearance ticket and the officers home address. You know in case he wants to apologize to the officer and his family.
 Thanks Andy
Hope the perp wasn’t out on ‘no bail’
2/ This is the climate people like @NYGovCuomo and @BilldeBlasio have created. This is the message they send when they free violent criminals within hours.
NY man killed by MS13; criminal justice prosecutors reveal evidence to the defense, allows“disclosure of the protected information to defense.” Cuomo has blood on his hands again. #@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @NYGovCuomo

When @nydems passed repeal of the RE, they did more than throw kids out of school. They created a path to hate, segregation, rejection, discrimination. Profoundly destructive. The good thing- they woke a sleeping tiger. #YouWentTooFar @NYGovCuomo
@NYGovCuomo would have the Presidents ear for the betterment of the state except for @NYGovCuomo political insanity. Green light law, end cash bail, closing prisons, protecting illegal aliens.
So either trump* or Gov Cuomo lied about this. Given past experience, which gentlemen should I believe? See, Mr. Trump, this is what happens when you habitually lie; no one believes anything you say.
That's not true.
It isn't illegal for the President of the United States to lie. In fact, nothing he does is criminal as long as 35 senators have his back. I think the Impeachment saga proves this.
Maybe if NYS actually followed federal law we would not have this problem
I believe you, Governor. I have taken everything Trump says as a lie and I believe the opposite. Seems to work for me.
@NYGovCuomo aids & abets Criminal Illegal Aliens with his idiotic laws which endanger and cost the lives of OUR own Citizens, and then he has the audacity to claim our @POTUS is abusing his power for Protecting Us All? #AsinineAndrew Cuomo has lost his mind! Cuomo=Public Danger.
Maybe you should’ve tweeted the request instead, you know he’s less than perfect with phone calls.
The conservative of NY need to do something. You may b]e conservative and not a Republican, I understand, I was once a Democrat, but I guess  to the lesser of two will say evils or the better for the majority of the people.
Maybe you need to be reminded about what some dirtbags that shouldn't have been I our country did to New York on 9/11!!!
Soon we will arrest you.
do you listen to the people of NY? Does not sound like it. Your time is limited.
Thank you. The #PeoplesBudget was updated without any dissent at our #TownHall on Wednesday night. We find over $440 billion in new Government funding by raising taxes on the wealthy. Three ideas in our People's Budget are legislation ready. #FullyFundNYCHA #MTAFree 
How about fixing the bail reform monstrosity you created. Do you feel bad for the witnesses killed on Long Island this week because of you.
As a NY’er, If you really wanted to help NY’ers, perhaps showing a little respect to the office might help? As in it’s “President Trump” @realDonaldTrump @POTUS & follow Federal Laws.. Not every little whim your progressive friends suggest. Just sayin’
Now DHS is blocking exports or cars titled in New York and affecting non New Yorkers now as well. I would say Tamp declared war on everyone and everything New York and anyone that does business in New York and buy New York cars. Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). need a class action
. @NYGovCuomo I bet you are on this list!! Anything to line your pockets & screw the hard working NY taxpayers. #CrookedCuomo #MAGA2020 #KAG2020  …
@NYGovCuomo stinks !
I guess it's who are you going to believe. It's no contest to me. WHICH one is allowing rapist, murders, robbers et al back onto the street right after being arrested...??? It's NOT the one at 1900 Pennsylvania avenue demonicRAT'S STOCK UP B*T*HES 
hmm... if that's true, Trump should make him his new best pal. Trump loves all of those traits.
