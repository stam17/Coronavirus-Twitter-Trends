Great 
Unfortunately it already is. Trumps gang hasn't had the balls to make testing and follow up a no cost for those in need. Cheers to Gov. Cuomo.
Indeed, again. The scare tactics of 'they want to increase taxes' continue but are waning. We should make every U.S. citizen travel abroad to open their eyes to this...  …

I agree. Disease like covid-19 is a public disease, not a personal disease. Gov should cover it 100pct.
This is actual leadership in real life. Thank you
He can't control that. He does what he can control. Now, the Federal Government can set up Free testing sites, But they wont. Vote #Bernie2020

New Yorkers receiving Medicaid coverage will not have to pay a co-pay for any testing related to #coronavirus. Currently all COVID-19 tests being conducted at the State's Wadsworth Lab are fully covered.

The difference between Cuomo and Trump is the governor has credibility and uses facts to explain why we should not panic. Cuomo is providing a calmness that is needed to give citizens the confidence in the people in charge.
I never thought I’d praise @NYGovCuomo but, nice job calming people down over the #CoronaVirusSA We have been through this MANY times. “Facts out weigh fears”. I always keep a bottle of hand sanitizer in my car, using it after food shopping, pumping gas, ATM etc..
During a press conference @NYGovCuomo just said that NYC has the best health system in the world. No joking. I don’t even know where to start in telling him that it is not. Maybe the Governor should spend some time traveling outside USA and educate himself #COVID19

In my opinion  in and out of areas with higher outbreaks need to be quarantine for how ever long it takes for symptoms to appear. I know it sucks for the person but we need to keep it from spreading before it's too late.

You don't have to touch anything... you just need to be breathing. You know those doctors masks you see people wearing? Not the n95 but the small ones? They are too keep you from infecting your environment.
The taxi and anyone who touched the taxi or road after her, her luggage , her money, her seat, the railings , door knobs or stood in her presence is now potentionally infected. Then anyone who came in contact with those people are possibly infected.
Low risk??? How about everyone on the plane, at the airport, taxi, uber, bus... How many people has she been in contact with before she tested positive and self quarantined? Also do we know how long this virus lives on objects touched? Definitely a lot of questions unanswered.
Yes and they are just running around all over NY infecting others. Or on planes Ingecting people.
Entire countries have shut down with fewer cases than ours have. China’s numbers are improving BECAUSE they took an aggressive approach. WHO  elderly & sick avoid crowds. They’ve moved Coronavirus to HIGHEST RISK. This is INADEQUATE.
