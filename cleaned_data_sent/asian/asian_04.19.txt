I think there’s a conversation to be had about the racism of specifically targeting Asian men for being feminine. Like, absolutely. But I think that using an LGBT man (Harry) as  is...not the correct message, especially if in the process they invalidate his sexuality

to say "i don't get it" as to why you don't understand why a south korean boyband is blowing up always feels weird to me. 1D blew up. 5sos blew up. no one really says "i don't get it" to them. but all of a sudden an asian boyband blows up and they're confused. music is music.
I'm already seeing white liberals get mad at East Asian people say the recent Biden ad has made them unable to "Vote Blue No Matter Who." Maybe go get your candidate in line, you're the only people Biden might listen to.
asian folk think this is breakfast
even my american filo friend told me last night to “stop crying over those boys they all look the same anyways” and then when i said that statement was a bit racist he pulled the “but i’m asian” card as if it makes his statement any less unintelligent
Biden, in fact, has been very good about calling out anti-Asian racism.  …

RT SO @SpeakerPelosi CLAIMS that @realDonaldTrump was encouraging others to discriminate against CHINESE AMERICANS & ASIAN AMERICANS. Hey SMIRNOFF!! CARE to show some examples of that? Or are you just lying your flapping lips off again?
We MUST not equate criticism of China's government with anti-Asian racism. Biden should call out and denounce anti-Asian racism. All our leaders should. But criticizing China's government is perfectly OK.  …
she describes asian men as dark hair and dark eyes. guys, apparently im asian men 
If you're only worried about Biden's anti-Chinese ads because of how they might affect Asian Americans, you need to broaden your worldview.
This ad is indeed devastating and ugly--because of its Yellow Peril imagery. One can rightfully criticize Trump's  response to #COVID19 without indulging in anti-Chinese rhetoric. This ad risks inciting more hate crimes against Asian Americans.  …
the fact that white men can wear unblended eyeshadow, a tutu and do the bare minimum, and theyll get the most praise for "breaking barriers of toxic masculinity" but when asian men like bts do all that and even outdo them in those respects, its suddenly ok to misgender them?
ongoing reminder to asians including myself that we find a way to address anti-asian racism and sinophobia while continuing to address anti-blackness.
What the hell is this, Joe? Are you really going to let Donald Trump define the political narrative and make this cycle a race to see how much each of you can attack China? The net result is going to be direct harm to Asian Americans. This is *deeply*, *gravely* disappointing.  …
Hi! There's nothing distinguishing the Chinese gov from Asians and Asian Americans. The folks who act violently against our Chinese & AAPI neighbors (some as young as kids & some including older adults) take that vague language & turn it into violent attacks against real people.

How are you gonna be racist to Asian men just because they look better than you 
asian languages and cultures are not interchangeable! do not make them that way!!!
No but TF does 'asian people should be allowed to look asian' even mean?? Is there a specific way asians are supposed to look when there's over 45 countries in asia?
For the record: - the Chinese government sucks and deserves criticism and opposition - calling out "the Chinese" is really not it, chief - whipping up anti-Chinese sentiment will impact all Asian-Americans because Americans have never and will never tell them apart - fuck you
All of them are Asian. ASIA DOESNT HAVE A ONE LOOK FITS ALL. 
so they can’t dye their hair and wear contacts like normal people just because they’re asian?? I’m so done with these people

i find it so funny how cishet white men are praised for adopting feminine traits and it is easily glorified as ending toxic masculinity but asian men get demasculined in a racial way for being themselves in general and harmful stereotypes are reinforced in every aspect
it’s something abt a white woman calling saying “asian men should look like asian men” that’s so funny to me bc she basically putting herself in a position where she’s the one who decides what asian men should look like hhhh
What tf does she mean “Asian people should be allowed to look Asian” is there a certain way Asian people should look???
is it weird that i think asian people should be allowed to be successful without getting racist backlash?
no but if we really want to get into it lets talk about how a lot of the "androgyny" bts would sometimes even be praised for in the west was actually just rooted in racist western feminizing of asian men
"Raithu Bazar" concept was introduced by My Leader. It was a good research study published in "Asian Journal of Management Research" My Leader supports farmers. Farmers also supported My Leader by giving 34000 acres for AMARAVATHI. That's the faith.

We have a Democrat running against Trump using the same racist garbage propaganda to pander to his supporters. Meanwhile thousands are dying, theres no safety net and hate crimes against Asian people are on the rise. We have a huge fight in our hands. I hope we are ready.

be wary of the US. they do not care about southeast asians, they bombed us and displaced millions & the US is the reason most cambodians live in poverty due to unforgiven WAR debt. they will use injustices against SE Asian nations to further their own imperialist agendas

Asian Americans make up 5.6% of total population. So far, both sides have lost Asian votes. We need a president that heals the country, not divide it. We need a president that brings everyone together! Bernie is still on the Ballot. A vote for Bernie is a vote for all of us

Asian ghosts are the scariest aND YOU CAN’T CHANGE MY MIND!!!!!!!

I was going to discriminate against Asian Americans but then @SpeakerPelosi told me not to. Thanks Nancy!
Conversely, the more right-wingers *ignore* racism against Asian-Americans the more they play into the hands of the Chinese state. The American ideological strength is premised on the idea that we are *not* an ethno-state.
Pelosi said that "leaders take responsibility" and do not blame others. However, when asked about her calling people out in mass to Chinatown in late February, she said it was because of what Trump "said about Asian Americans." Trump did refer to "the Chinese virus," not citizens
Conflating the Chinese government with people of Asian descent is the goal of the Chinese state. But there is Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Phillipines, etc, plus plenty of Taiwanese-Americans who hate China. The left isn't stopping racism, they are parroting ethno-nationalism.

They are either dead or missing. As my Japanese friend warns, if you don’t always assume the Chinese government is always lying, your a fool. Asian leaders already knew this. It’s the West who wanted to believe differently, except, if we’re honest & have to admit, Donald Trump.  …
