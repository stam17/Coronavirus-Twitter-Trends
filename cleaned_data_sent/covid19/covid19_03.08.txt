Major issue with this thread...it assumes that #COVID19 is a lethal pandemic disease. It isn't that bad. It is only a serious risk to certain vulnerable groups. Those who've had it say it's not as bad as flu and doesn't last. Look at the figures. The %'s are very low.

Important reminder: If a test is negative after experiencing symptoms, that’s not an “all clear.” You could still be contagious with other viruses, so continue to use best practices to keep people safe and prevent the spread of #COVID19 or any other respiratory illness. 
I hope the upside of #Covid19 will be an appreciation for the value of public services, the end of blind austerity & seeing paying tax as an important way we look after one another. #cdnpoli

The 1957 pandemic ended as people became immune over a period of three years. Possibly the virus became less virulent too. We can expect COVID19 to similarly  'endemic,' but probably after several waves of affliction, alas.  … 19/
But mortality from 1957 outbreak in the USA was U-shaped, as most pandemics are, killing the very young (<5) and very old (>65).  This is different than COVID19, which seems to spare the young (like some other flus)  …). 
Pertinently, NOT everyone was afflicted in 1957, however. The overall attack rate was 41% in LA & 34% in MO. For COVID19, experts like @mlipsitch estimate that 20-60% of people will ultimately contract the pathogen. This is typical of flu epidemics.  15/
