#COVID19 is more virulent than the flu. One person with COVID-19 can infect many, many more without showing any symptoms. Once someone is exposed, it can take a long time – as much as 14 days – to develop illness.
If you think this is “just the flu” – you are 100% wrong. In just six weeks, we’ve lost 4,070 New Jerseyans to #COVID19. That’s more than @CDCgov statistics show we’ve lost over the past three entire flu seasons COMBINED.
Canada and the United States have today agreed to extend by 30 days the border measures that are currently in place. This is an important decision, and one that will help keep people safe. #COVID19
