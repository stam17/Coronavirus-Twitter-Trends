Well, it’s started. Instead of being asked about how we improve our #COVID19 response in  months, doctors are being asked  on why people shouldn’t drink things like bleach or isopropyl alcohol. This has to stop. This is the problem. This has to stop.
Tonight members of @SEIUHCWI—the union of health care workers — placed 1,300 candles on the steps of the state Capitol in recognition of every Wisconsinite who has been hospitalized with #COVID19. This is truth against lies. This is love against division. This is solidarity. 
Tonight our president publicly surmised that injecting disinfectants into the body might “cleanse” #COVID19, like some kind of juicing. As a GI doctor who has seen the catastrophic result of ingesting disinfectants (example below), I can confirm it’s an awful idea. Mind. Boggled.

If you’re wondering why @realDonaldTrump suggested injecting people with disinfectant to cure #COVID19 (or shining lights into their bodies) - it’s because he’s stupid. Mystery solved. Remember he also wanted to stop a hurricane by nuking it. Dumb as a brick. Comically stupid.

There have been reports this week of patients not seeking urgent medical care for heart attack or stroke because of #COVID19 fears. Dr. Darryl Sleep, Amgen’s Chief Medical Officer, has a message: hospital ERs are still equipped to handle medical emergencies beyond COVID-19.
#FakeNews CNN said President Trump suggested injecting bleach... did anyone hear President Trump say any such thing? I believe he asked the Dr. what they were researching in regards to new evidence discovered about the affects of UV and disinfectants on #COVID19. 
The questions Trump asks the Covid19 task force will be bombshells in future books unless Trump continues to reveal his questions at the briefings because he’s the stupidest person in the world.
