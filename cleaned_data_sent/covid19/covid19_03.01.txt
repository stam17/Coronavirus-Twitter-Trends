So I think the plan, if there is one, is to let it burn through the population, a bunch of ppl will get it but will never be tested, so in the end it'll be possible to say "way more people died from the flu that year than from COVID19." "But the flu..." is actually the endgame.

I'm pretty sure PH right now has more COVID19 cases than what's actually reported in the news. Remember, most FILIPINOS DO NOT like getting medical checkups due to lack of funds or the fear of hospital bills. That means, more COVID patients running around unchecked. Just sayin
The U.S. has 335 reported cases of coronavirus, but 17 deaths. That’s a 5% morbidity rate ( @realDonaldTrump said his “hunch” is it’s less than 1%). Assuming the U.S. death rate isn’t higher than the 3.4% rate in other countries, the U.S. likely has >500 cases of #COVID19.
So if the best guess for #COVID19 requires 1.9 million ICU beds for patients in the USA, how many ICU beds do we have in this country? Around 95,000 ICU beds according to 2015 AHA survey. And many are already occupied by patients without COVID19. How do we prepare for this?

As COVID19 cases saturate virtually every state and county, which seems likely to happen any day now, it will soon be irresponsible for all HCWs to not wear a mask. These HCWs would burn through N95 stockpile in 2 days if each HCW only got ONE mask per day. 15/n
If only 5% of cases require it, we can make it until ~May 14th. 2.5% gets us to May 20th. This, of course, assumes that there is no uptick in demand for beds from *other* (non-COVID19) causes, which seems like a dubious assumption. 11/n
