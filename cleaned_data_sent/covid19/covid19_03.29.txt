COVID-19 Update: Saturday, 4/4/20 Here’s the latest missive on the #COVID19 crisis from Dr. Craig Smith:  
But the drug supply chain is one of just-in-time production and distribution. Nobody has 2 times, let alone 10 times, the amount of drugs on hand that are going to be needed for the surge in COVID19 patients. We need more drugs now. 24/
Of course, we also need these agents to actually treat patients with COVID19 who are *not* expected to die! These drugs are essential to keep patients sedated while they are on a ventilator. Otherwise, they often thrash and pull out their life-saving tubes. 23/
In many cases, the sedative and other drugs needed to treat COVID19 patients triaged to not get ventilators are the same as those necessary to care for patients on ventilators! 17/
Where do we stand in terms of our preparation to care for COVID19 patients, not just in terms of beds and palliative medicine personnel, but also the crucial drugs for treating such patients, if they have been triaged away from ventilators? 16/

And I am worried we are not adequately prepared to cope with the psychological aspects of often unusual COVID19 deaths (sudden, alone, or as a result of triage, etc.) either — for the patients themselves (if they are conscious) and their families. 6/
I am very worried we will not have the medications (and personnel) we need in the USA to properly treat symptoms of dyspnea (shortness of breath), air hunger, pain, thirst, and anxiety near the end of life for COVID19 patients denied ventilators. @NHPCO_news 5/
It’s not just a question of “optimal” triage polices for access to ventilators or ICU beds (now tragically being promulgated in hospitals around the USA). Rather, it's a question regarding how will we care for the COVID19 patients whom we triage to allow to die. 2/
People who are dying of COVID19 will need first-rate palliative (hospice) care. This is going to be especially the case for people who are denied ventilators or who are taken off of them (i.e., who are “extubated”). Let’s talk about this painful and poignant fact. 1/
