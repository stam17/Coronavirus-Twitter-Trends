4. Our crisis is not just a #COVID19 crisis; it has always been a public health crisis - the result of decades of neglect by government. Why would they invest in public health when they don’t use the system? As much as Moyo is a liability he did not create this farce. ZANU PF did
3. Zimbabwe’s flawed #COVID19 strategy is not Moyo’s strategy. It is ED’s strategy. Asking ED to fire Moyo is a typically Zimbabwean way of dealing with a problem: go after the easy target - a clueless Minister, as if the boss who must operate the political guillotine has a clue.
2. Responsibility for handling the #COVID19 pandemic is too big to be placed on the doorstep of a Health Minister. Across the world, the head of government is taking a hands-on approach to the crisis. They are taking direct responsibility. Our main guy must take responsibility.
Currently, #ECB/NCBs bought and holds c. 33% of the #debt of each euro Member State With the disaster of #COVID19, it will easily raise to 50% It would be absolute folly to release this debt back on the markets And it would be just ridiculous not to cancel it before maturity  …
Antibody testing will potentially show cases where people positive for COVID19, but who were asymptomatic, were allowed to continue  into a workplace, putting others in direct harm vs those with COVID19 negative results & of no potential harm. Will be very interesting.
Another thing the National and international response to #Covid19 is showing us is just how many people are inconsiderate selfish bastards.
GOP ghouls don't seem to care that 20,000 Americans are dead due to  and total ignorance of the experts who warned of covid19 going back to Jan/Feb. This crisis is far from being over, and GOP wants to reopen for business. That guarantees a high body count.

It's interesting how Corona Virus became Covid19 in all reporting. Reminds me how the Taliban became ISIS them ISIL. The narrative has to keep evolving to keep people in a constant state of confusion, never clearly understanding what's going on. These devils are extremely cunning
Serological (antibody) tests are needed for #COVID19 vaccine trials and for understanding exposure. They are not likely to have a major impact on getting people back to work soon, because 1) <10% of the US has been infected; 2) we don't know what antibody levels provide immunity.
